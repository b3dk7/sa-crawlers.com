More than a hundred banks and financial institutions across the world have been infected with a dangerous sophisticated, memory-based malware that's almost undetectable, researchers warned.

Newly published report by the Russian security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab indicates that hackers are targeting banks, telecommunication companies, and government organizations in 40 countries, including the US, South America, Europe and Africa, with Fileless malware that resides solely in the memory of the compromised computers.

Fileless malware was first discovered by the same security firm in 2014, has never been mainstream until now.

Fileless malware is a piece of nasty software that does not copy any files or folder to the hard drive in order to get executed. Instead, payloads are directly injected into the memory of running processes, and the malware executes in the system's RAM.

Since the malware runs in the memory, the memory acquisition becomes useless once the system gets rebooted, making it difficult for digital forensic experts to find the traces of the malware.

The attack was initially discovered by a bank's security team after they found a copy of Meterpreter ‚Äî an in-memory component of Metasploit ‚Äî inside the physical memory of a Microsoft domain controller.


After conducting a forensic analysis, Kaspersky researchers found that the attackers leveraged Windows PowerShell to load the Meterpreter code directly into memory rather than writing it to the disk.

The cyber crooks also used Microsoft's NETSH networking tool to set up a proxy tunnel for communicating with the command and control (C&C) server and remotely controlling the infected host.

They also stashed the PowerShell commands into the Windows registry in an effort to reduce nearly all traces of the attacks left in logs or hard drive after a reboot of the device, making detection and forensic analysis difficult.

The ultimate goal of the attackers was apparently aimed at compromising computers that control ATMs so that they could steal money.

Kaspersky Lab researchers plan to reveal more details in April about the attack, which is occurring on an industrial scale worldwide.

The attack has already hit more than 140 enterprise networks in business sectors, with most victims located in the US, France, Ecuador, Kenya, the UK, and Russia. And since the threat is so hard to spot, the actual number is likely much higher.

Last month, we reported about a group of hackers exploiting SambaCry‚Äîa 7-year-old critical remote code execution vulnerability in Samba networking software‚Äîto hack Linux computers and install malware to mine cryptocurrencies.

The same group of hackers is now targeting Windows machines with a new backdoor, which is a QT-based re-compiled version of the same malware used to target Linux.

Dubbed CowerSnail, detected by security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Labs as Backdoor.Win32.CowerSnail, is a fully-featured windows backdoor that allows its creators to remotely execute any commands on the infected systems.

Wondering how these two separate campaigns are connected?

Interestingly, the CowerSnail backdoor uses the same command and control (C&C) server as the malware that was used to infect Linux machines to mine cryptocurrency last month by exploiting the then-recently exposed SambaCry vulnerability.

Common C&C Server Location ‚Äî cl.ezreal.space:20480
SambaCry vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494), named due to its similarities to the Windows SMB flaw exploited by the WannaCry ransomware that recently wreaked havoc worldwide, affected all Samba versions newer than Samba 3.5.0 released over the past seven years.

Shortly after the public revelation of its existence, SambaCry was exploited by this group of hackers to remotely install cryptocurrency mining software‚Äî"CPUminer" that mines cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero and others‚Äîon Linux systems.

But now, the same hackers are targeting both, Windows and Linux computers, with CPUminer by utilising computing resources of the compromised systems in order to make the profit.

"After creating two separate Trojans, each designed for a specific platform and each with its own peculiarities, it is highly probable that this group will produce more malware in the future," Sergey Yunakovsky of Kaspersky Lab said in a blog post.
In separate research, security researcher Omri Ben Bassat‚Äè reported about more copycat groups of hackers who are exploiting the same SambaCry vulnerability for cryptocurrency mining and installing "Tsunami backdoor," an IRC-based DDoS botnet malware that's been known for infecting Mac OS X and IoT devices in the past.

For those unaware: Samba is open-source software (re-implementation of SMB/CIFS networking protocol) that offers Linux/Unix servers with Windows-based file and print services and runs on the majority of operating systems and IoT devices.

Despite being patched in late May, the SambaCry bug is actively being exploited by hackers. Just last week, researchers spotted a new piece of malware, called SHELLBIND, exploiting the flaw to backdoor Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices.

So far, nobody had an idea that who was behind WannaCry ransomware attacks?

But now there is a clue that lies in the code.

Neel Mehta, a security researcher at Google, found evidence that suggests the WannaCry ransomware, that infected 300,000 machines in 150 countries over the weekend, is linked to a state-sponsored hacking group in North Korea, known for cyber attacks against South Korean organizations.


What's Happening? What is WannaCry?
This is the fifth day since the WannaCry ransomware attack surfaced, that leverages a critical Windows SMB exploit and still infecting machines across the world using newly released variants that don't have any "kill switch" ability.

In case, if you have landed on WannaCry story for the first time, and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, you are advised to also read this simple, summarized, but detailed explanation:

WannaCry: What Has Happened So Far & How to protect your PCs


WannaCry: First Nation-State Powered Ransomware?


Neel discovered that the code found in the WannaCry malware‚Äîone that first surfaced in February‚Äîwas identical to the code used in an early 2015 version of Cantopee, a malicious backdoor developed by Lazarus Group, believed to be a state-sponsored hacking group linked to the North Korean government.

Security researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, Intezer, Symantec, and Comae Technologies immediately followed the tip from Neel and confirmed a strong link between WannaCry and other malware families, including Lazarus, Joanap, and Brambul, which suggests WannaCry was written or modified by the same author.


Operating since at least 2011, Lazarus Group of hackers believed to be responsible for the 2013 DarkSeoul operation, the devastating 2014 Sony Pictures Hack, and the 2016 Bangladesh $81 Million bank heist.

However, this finding is not yet sufficient to link the Lazarus Group to WannaCry, because it is possible that WannaCry authors may have purposely copied code from Lazarus' backdoor program in an attempt to mislead researchers and law enforcement as they investigate.

"We believe that there are sufficient connections to warrant further investigation. We will continue to share further details of our research as it unfolds," says Symantec, the security firm which has tracked the Lazarus over recent years.

Agreeing to the same, Matt Suiche from Comaeio said:


"The attribution to Lazarus Group would make sense regarding their narrative which in the past was dominated by infiltrating financial institutions in the goal of stealing money. If validated, this means the latest iteration of WannaCry would, in fact, be the first nation state powered ransomware."


Is the WannaCry Attack Over? *NO*

Absolutely Not; this is just the beginning.

Security researchers have discovered some new variants of this ransomware, which could not be stopped by the kill switch, so you are advised to make sure you have applied the patch for SMB vulnerability and disabled SMBv1 protocol to keep your Windows computers safe from WannaCry and other similar attacks.

The WannaCry attackers demand ransom fees between $300 to $600 to free the hijacked data. The three bitcoin wallets tied to #WannaCry ransomware have received 225 payments totaling 35.98003282 BTC (approx. $60,000) from ransomware victims.

The infamous mobile banking trojan that recently added ransomware features to steal sensitive data and lock user files at the same time has now been modified to steal credentials from Uber and other booking apps as well.

Security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab have discovered a new variant of the Android banking Trojan called Faketoken that now has capabilities to detect and record an infected device's calls and display overlays on top of taxi booking apps to steal banking information.

Dubbed Faketoken.q, the new variant of mobile banking trojan is being distributed using bulk SMS messages as their attack vector, prompting users to download an image file that actually downloads the malware.


Malware Spy On Telephonic Conversations

Once downloaded, the malware installs the necessary modules and the main payload, which hides its shortcut icon and begins monitoring everything‚Äîfrom every calls to launched apps‚Äîthat happens on the infected Android device.

When calls are made to or received from certain phone numbers on the victim's device, the malware begins to record those conversations and sends the recordings to the attacker's server.

Moreover, Faketoken.q also checks which apps the smartphone owner is using and when detects the launch of an app whose interface it can simulate, the Trojan immediately overlays the app with a fake user interface.


Malware Exploits Overlay Feature to Steal Credit Card Details


In order to achieve this, the Trojan uses the same standard Android feature that is being employed by a whole bunch of legitimate apps, such as Facebook Messenger, window managers, and other apps, to show screen overlays on top of all other apps.

The fake user interface prompts victims to enter his or her payment card data, including the bank‚Äôs verification code, which can later be used by attackers to initiate fraudulent transactions.

Faketoken.q is capable of overlaying a large number of mobile banking apps as well as miscellaneous applications, such as:


Android Pay
Google Play Store
Apps for paying traffic tickets
Apps for booking flights and hotel rooms
Apps for booking taxis


Since fraudsters require an SMS code sent by the bank to authorise a transaction, the malware steals incoming SMS message codes and forward them to the attackers command-and-control (C&C) server for a successful attack.

According to the researchers, Faketoken.q has been designed to target Russian-speaking users, as it uses the Russian language on the user interface.


Ways to Protect Against Such Android Banking Trojans

The easiest way to prevent yourself being a victim of such mobile banking Trojans is to avoid downloading apps via links provided in messages or emails, or any third-party app store.

You can also go to Settings ‚Üí Security and make sure "Unknown sources" option is turned off in order to block installation of apps from unknown sources.

Most importantly, verify app permissions before installing apps, even if it is downloaded from official Google Play. If you find any app asking more than what it is meant for, just do not install it.

It's always a good idea to install an antivirus app from a reputed vendor that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device, and always keep your system and apps up-to-date.

Since its launch over a month ago, new virtual currency Zcash (ZEC) has become a significant way for cybercrooks to make money by infecting computers with software mining program.

Launched in late October, Zcash (ZEC) is a new cryptocurrency currency that claims to be more anonymous than Bitcoin, as the sender, recipient and value of transactions can be hidden.

With this premise, Zcash attracted significant interest from academics, investors, miners, and cyber criminals. Within the first few hours of its launch, 1 ZEC reached $30,000, a relatively high value any cryptocurrency ever had.

At the time of writing, 1 ZEC is worth 0.06 BTC or around $49.

However, according to a blog post published on Monday by<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, cyber criminals have already started deploying malware that installs on and infects the computers of unsuspecting users and then uses their resources to mine Zcash for the hacker's profit.


You¬†Might have Zcash Mining Malware on Your PC!

The actual software is not illegal nor infected with malware. It is just meant to be used by willing individuals to dedicate their computer resources for mining Zcash. Mining is basically solving math problems for a reward in the virtual currency.

However, researchers noted that hackers are distributing malicious software via links for things like pirated software, forcing unwilling users' computers to mine Zcash without their knowledge.

"Cybercriminals use rather conventional ways to distribute mining software ‚Äì they are installed under the guise of other legitimate programs, such as pirated software distributed via torrents," said Kaspersky Lab security researcher Aleks Gostev.¬†

"So far, we have not seen any cases of mass-mailings or vulnerabilities in websites being exploited to distribute mining software; however, provided mining remains as profitable as it is now, this is only a matter of time."
Once installed, the malware forces a victim's computer to mine Zcash and transfers the funds to the attacker.

Kaspersky Lab has so far detected around 1,000 possibly infected computers that have some versions of the Zcash miner software under a different name such as system.exe, diskmngr.exe, taskmngr.exe or svchost.exe.

This number of infected computers could generate as much as $75,000 a year in income.


Here's How to Check if Your Computer is Mining Zcash without your Knowledge

Since cryptocurrency mining operation is power hungry, the computer uses up a lot more electricity that could end you up paying a hefty electricity bill.

So, if you have noticed your recent electricity bill to be unexpectedly excessive, chances are a Zcash cryptocurrency miner is running in the background.

Besides this, the mining operation typically eats up 90 percent of your system's RAM, which dramatically slows down the speed of both the operating system as well as other applications running on the computer.

If this is also happening to you, your computer is running a miner without your knowledge or consent.

The worst part of this particular miner is that it gets restarted each time the host computer is restarted. So, switching the computer off and on will not change the situation.

The anti-virus company has also provided a list of processes and programs (executables and DLLs) that, if found on your computer, indicate that your system is covertly mining crypto coins for hackers.

For more technical details on the new malware campaign, you can head on to the Kaspersky Lab's blog post.

Remember SambaCry?

Two weeks ago we reported about a 7-year-old critical remote code execution vulnerability in Samba networking software (re-implementation of SMB networking protocol) that allows a remote hacker to take full control of a vulnerable Linux and Unix machines.

To know more about the SambaCry vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) and how it works, you can read our previous article. 

At that time, nearly 485,000 Samba-enabled computers were found to be exposed on the Internet, and researchers predicted that the SambaCry-based attacks also have potential to spread just like WannaCry ransomware widely.

The prediction came out to be quite accurate, as honeypots set up by the team of researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab have captured a malware campaign that is exploiting SambaCry vulnerability to infect Linux computers with cryptocurrency mining software.

Another security researcher, Omri Ben Bassat‚Äè, independently discovered¬†the same campaign and named it "EternalMiner."

According to the researchers, an unknown group of hackers has started hijacking Linux PCs just a week after the Samba flaw was disclosed publicly and installing an upgraded version of "CPUminer," a cryptocurrency mining software that mines "Monero" digital currency.

After compromising the vulnerable machines using SambaCry vulnerability, attackers execute two payloads on the targeted systems:

INAebsGB.so ‚Äî A reverse-shell that provides remote access to the attackers.
cblRWuoCc.so ‚Äî A backdoor that includes cryptocurrency mining utilities ‚Äì CPUminer.


"Through the reverse-shell left in the system, the attackers can change the configuration of a miner already running or infect the victim‚Äôs computer with other types of malware," Kaspersky researchers say.
Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment as it requires an enormous amount of computing power, but such cryptocurrency-mining malware makes it easier for cybercriminals by allowing them to utilise computing resources of compromised systems to make the profit.

If you have been following The Hacker News regularly, you must be aware of Adylkuzz, a cryptocurrency-mining malware that was using Windows SMB vulnerability at least two weeks before the outbreak of WannaCry ransomware attacks.

The Adylkuzz malware was also mining Monero by utilizing the enormous amount of computing resources of the compromised Windows systems.



The attackers behind SambaCry-based CPUminer attack have already earned 98 XMR, which worth 5,380 today and this figure is continuously rising with the increase in the number of compromised Linux systems.

"During the first day they gained about 1 XMR (about $55 according to the currency exchange rate for 08.06.2017), but during the last week they gained about 5 XMR per day," the researchers say.
The maintainers of Samba has already patched the issue in their new Samba versions 4.6.4/4.5.10/4.4.14, and are urging those using a vulnerable version of Samba to install the patch as soon as possible.

By now I am sure you have already heard something about the WannaCry ransomware, and are wondering what's going on, who is doing this, and whether your computer is secure from this insanely fast-spreading threat that has already hacked nearly 200,000 Windows PCs over the weekend.

The only positive thing about this attack is that ‚Äî you are here ‚Äî as after reading this easy-to-understandable awareness article, you would be so cautious that you can save yourself from WannaCry, as well as other similar cyber attacks in the future.

Also Read ‚Äî Google Researcher Finds Link Between WannaCry Attacks and North Korea.

Since this widely spread ransomware attack is neither the first nor the last one to hit users worldwide, prevention is always the key to protect against such malware threats.

What is WannaCry? How to Protect your Computer from WannaCry Ransomware? Follow These Simple Steps.
 TWEET THIS 
In this article, we have provided some of the most important primary security tips that you should always follow and advised to share with everyone you care for.

What is Ransomware & Why WannaCry is More Dangerous?(A simple video demonstrating of WannaCry Ransomware, showing how fast it spreads from system-to-system without any user Interaction)

For those unaware, Ransomware is a computer virus that usually spreads via spam emails and malicious download links; specially designed to lock up the files on a computer, until the victim pays the ransom demand, usually $300-$500 in Bitcoins.

But what makes WannaCry so unique and nasty is its ability to self-spread without even need to click any link or a file.

The WannaCry ransomware, also known as Wanna Decryptor, leverages a Windows SMB exploit, dubbed EternalBlue, that allows a remote hacker to hijack computers running on unpatched Microsoft Windows operating system.

Once infected, WannaCry also scans for other unpatched PCs connected to the same local network, as well as scans random hosts on the wider Internet, to spread itself quickly.

What Has Happened So FarWe have been covering this story since Friday when this malware was first emerged and hit several hospitals across the globe, eventually forcing them to shut down their entire IT systems over the weekend, hence rejecting patients appointments, and cancel operations.

Later this cyber attack brought down many organizations to their knees.

Instead of repeating same details again, read our previous articles dig deeper and know what has happened so far:

Day 1: OutCry¬†‚Äî¬†WannaCry targeted over 90,000 computers in 99 countries.
Day 2: The Patch Day¬†‚Äî¬†A security researcher successfully found a way to slow down the infection rate, and meanwhile, Microsoft releases emergency patch updates for unsupported versions of Windows.
Day 3: New Variants Arrives¬†‚Äî¬†Just yesterday, some new variants of WannaCry, with and without a kill-switch, were detected in the wild would be difficult to stop for at least next few weeks.

Isn‚Äôt the Cyber Attack Over?
Absolutely not.

This is just beginning. As I reported yesterday, security researchers have detected some new versions of this ransomware, dubbed WannaCry 2.0, which couldn‚Äôt be stopped by the kill switch. 

What's even worse is that the new WannaCry variant believed to be created by someone else, and not the hackers behind the first WannaCry ransomware.

It has been speculated that now other organized cybercriminal gangs, as well as script-kiddies can get motivated by this incident to create and spread similar malicious ransomware.

How to Protect Yourself from WannaCry Ransomware?
Here are some simple tips you should always follow because most computer viruses make their ways into your systems due to lack of simple security practices:

1. Always Install Security UpdatesIf you are using any version of Windows, except Windows 10, with SMB protocol enabled, make sure your computer should always receive updates automatically from the Microsoft, and it‚Äôs up-to-date always.

2. Patch SMB VulnerabilitySince WannaCry has been exploiting a critical SMB remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-0148) for which Microsoft has already released a patch (MS17-010) in the month of March, you are advised to ensure your system has installed those patches.

Moreover, Microsoft has been very generous to its users in this difficult time that the company has even released the SMB patches (download from here) for its unsupported versions of Windows as well, including Windows XP, Vista, 8, Server 2003 and 2008.

Note:¬†If you are using Windows 10 Creators Update (1703), you are not vulnerable to SMB vulnerability.

3. Disable SMBEven if you have installed the patches, you are advised to disable Server Message Block version 1 (SMBv1) protocol, which is enabled by default on Windows, to prevent against WannaCry ransomware attacks.

Here's the list of simple steps you can follow to disable SMBv1:
Go to Windows' Control Panel and open 'Programs.'
Open 'Features' under Programs and click 'Turn Windows Features on and off.'
Now, scroll down to find 'SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support' and uncheck it.
Then click OK, close the control Panel and restart the computer.

4. Enable Firewall & Block SMB PortsAlways keep your firewall enabled, and if you need to keep SMBv1 enabled, then just modify your firewall configurations to block access to SMB ports over the Internet. The protocol operates on TCP ports 137, 139, and 445, and over UDP ports 137 and 138.

5. Use an Antivirus ProgramAn evergreen solution to prevent against most threats is to use a good antivirus software from a reputable vendor and always keep it up-to-date.

Almost all antivirus vendors have already added detection capability to block WannaCry, as well as to prevent the secret installations from malicious applications in the background.

6. Be Suspicious of Emails, Websites, and AppsUnlike WannaCry, most ransomware spread through phishing emails, malicious adverts on websites, and third-party apps and programs.

So, you should always exercise caution when opening uninvited documents sent over an email and clicking on links inside those documents unless verifying the source to safeguard against such ransomware infection.

Also, never download any app from third-party sources, and read reviews even before installing apps from official stores.

7. Regular Backup your Files:To always have a tight grip on all your important documents and files, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device which is not always connected to your computer.

That way, if any ransomware infects you, it can not encrypt your backups.

8. Keep Your Knowledge Up-to-DateThere's not a single day that goes without any report on cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in popular software and services, such as Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and Mac Computers as well.

So, it‚Äôs high time for users of any domain to follow day-to-day happening of the cyber world, which would not only help them to keep their knowledge up-to-date, but also prevent against even sophisticated cyber attacks.

What to do if WannaCry infects you?
Well, nothing.

If WannaCry ransomware has infected you, you can‚Äôt decrypt your files until you pay a ransom money to the hackers and get a secret key to unlock your file.

Never Pay the Ransom:It‚Äôs up to the affected organizations and individuals to decide whether or not to pay the ransom, depending upon the importance of their files locked by the ransomware.

But before making any final decision, just keep in mind: there's no guarantee that even after paying the ransom, you would regain control of your files.

Moreover, paying ransom also encourages cyber criminals to come up with similar threats and extort money from the larger audience.

So, sure shot advice to all users is ‚Äî Don't Pay the Ransom.

Who's Behind WannaCry & Why Would Someone Do This?
Update: Also Read ‚Äî¬†Google Researcher Finds Link Between WannaCry Attacks and North Korea.

While it's still not known who is behind WannaCry, such large-scale cyber attacks are often propagated by nation states, but this ongoing attack does not bear any link to foreign governments.
"The recent attack is at an unprecedented level and will require a complex international investigation to identify the culprits," said Europol, Europe's police agency.Why are they hijacking hundreds of thousands of computers around the globe? Simple ‚Äî to extort money by blackmailing infected users.
By looking at the infection rate, it seems like the criminals responsible for this absurd attack would have made lots and lots of dollars so far, but surprisingly they have made relatively little in the way of profits, according to @actual_ransom, a Twitter account that‚Äôs tweeting details of every single transaction.

At the time of writing, the WannaCry attackers have received 171 payments totaling 27.96968763 BTC ($47,510.71 USD).

Who is responsible for WannaCry Attack?
‚Äî Is it Microsoft who created an operating system with so many vulnerabilities?

‚Äî Or is it the NSA, the intelligence agency of the United States, who found this critical SMB vulnerability and indirectly, facilitates WannaCry like attacks by not disclosing it to Microsoft?

‚Äî Or is it the Shadow Brokers, the hacking group, who managed to hack the NSA servers, but instead of reporting it to Microsoft, they decided to dump hacking tools and zero-day exploits in public?

‚Äî Or is it the Windows users themselves, who did not install the patches on their systems or are still using an unsupported version of Windows?

I do not know who can be blamed for this attack, but according to me, all of them shares equal responsibility.

Microsoft Blames NSA/CIA for WannaCry Cyber Attack
Microsoft has hit out at the US government for facilitating cyber attacks, like WannaCry, by not disclosing the software vulnerabilities to the respective vendors and holding them for their benefits, like global cyber espionage.

In a blog post on Sunday, Microsoft President Brad Smith condemned the US intelligence agencies‚Äô unethical practices, saying that the "widespread damage" caused by WannaCry happened due to the NSA, CIA and other intelligence agencies for holding zero-days and allowing them to be stolen by hackers.
"This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world," Smith said.This statement also publicly confirms that the hacking tools and exploits leaked by the Shadow Brokers belong to Equation Group, an elite group of hackers from NSA.
"Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage," Smith wrote.
You Should Thank These Experts
When the outbreak of WannaCry ransomware started on Friday night, It had already infected at least 30,000 computers worldwide, and at that moment nobody had an idea what‚Äôs happening and how the ransomware can spread itself like a worm so quickly.

Since then, in last three days, some cybersecurity experts and companies are continuously working hard, day and night, to analyze malware samples to find every possible way to stop this massive attack.

WikiLeaks has published a new batch of the ongoing Vault 7 leak, detailing a spyware framework ‚Äì which "provides remote beacon and loader capabilities on target computers" ‚Äì allegedly being used by the CIA that works against every version of Microsoft's Windows operating systems, from Windows XP to Windows 10.

Dubbed Athena/Hera, the spyware has been designed to take full control over the infected Windows PCs remotely, allowing the agency to perform all sorts of things on the target machine, including deleting data or uploading malicious software, and stealing data and send them to CIA server.

The leak, which includes a user manual of Athena, overview of the technology, and demonstration on how to use this spyware, reveals that the program has two implications:

Primary: Athena for XP to Windows 10¬†
Secondary: Hera for Windows 8 through Windows 10

According to the whistleblower organization, Athena has the ability to allow the CIA agents to modify its configuration in real time, while the implant is on target "to customize it to an operation."

"Once installed, the malware provides a beaconing capability (including configuration and task handling), the memory loading/unloading of malicious payloads for specific tasks and the delivery and retrieval of files to/from a specified directory on the target system," WikiLeaks claims.
The leaked documents suggest that Athena, written in Python programming language, was developed in August 2015, just a month after Microsoft released its Windows 10 operating system.

Interestingly, one document also suggests that the CIA agents have been advised to make sure that the spyware should not get caught by antivirus software programs, especially<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>AV software.


Athena has been developed by the CIA in cooperation with Siege Technologies ‚Äì an American cyber security firm that offers offensive cyber war technologies and works in close cooperation with the United States government.

However, WikiLeaks has not provided any detail about the operations being conducted by the agency using Athena, but it is not hard to imagine how the intelligence agency would be using this program to spy on their targets.

Last week, WikiLeaks dumped two apparent CIA malware frameworks ‚Äì¬†AfterMidnight and Assassin¬†‚Äì for the Microsoft Windows platform that has been designed to monitor and report back actions on the infected remote host computer and execute malicious actions.

Since March, the whistleblowing group has published nine batches of "Vault 7" series, which includes the latest and last week leaks, along with the following batches:

Archimedes ‚Äì a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack tool allegedly created by the CIA to target computers inside a Local Area Network (LAN).
Scribbles ‚Äì a piece of software allegedly designed to embed 'web beacons' into confidential documents, allowing the spying agency to track insiders and whistleblowers.
Grasshopper ‚Äì reveal a framework which allowed the agency to easily create custom malware for breaking into Microsoft's Windows and bypassing antivirus protection.
Marble ‚Äì revealed the source code of a secret anti-forensic framework, basically an obfuscator or a packer used by the CIA to hide the actual source of its malware.
Dark Matter ‚Äì focused on hacking exploits the agency designed to target iPhones and Macs.
Weeping Angel ‚Äì spying tool used by the agency to infiltrate smart TV's, transforming them into covert microphones.
Year Zero ‚Äì dumped CIA hacking exploits for popular hardware and software.

Ransomware has been around for a few years but has become an albatross around everyone's neck‚Äîfrom big businesses and financial institutions to hospitals and individuals worldwide‚Äîwith cyber criminals making millions of dollars.

In just past few months, we saw a scary strain of ransomware attacks including WannaCry, Petya and LeakerLocker, which made chaos worldwide by shutting down hospitals, vehicle manufacturing, telecommunications, banks and many businesses.

Before WannaCry and Petya, the infamous Mamba full-disk-encrypting ransomware and the Locky ransomware had made chaos across the world last year, and the bad news is‚Äîthey are back with their new and more damaging variants than ever before.


Diablo6: New Variant of Locky Ransomware


First surfaced in early 2016, Locky has been one of the largest distributed ransomware infections, infecting organisations across the globe.

By tricking victims into clicking on a malicious attachment, Locky ransomware encrypts nearly all file formats on a victim's computer and network and unlocks them until the ransom in Bitcoins is paid to attackers.

The ransomware has made many comebacks with its variants being distributed through Necurs botnet and Dridex botnet.

This time security researchers have discovered a fresh spam malware campaign distributing a new variant of Locky known as Diablo6 and targeting computers around the world, with the United States being the most targeted country, followed by Austria.

An independent security researcher using online alias Racco42 first spotted the new Locky variant that encrypts files on infected computers and appends the .diablo6 file extension.

Like usually, the ransomware variant comes in an email containing a Microsoft Word file as an attachment, which when opened, a VBS Downloader script is executed that then attempts to download the Locky Diablo6 payload from a remote file server.

The ransomware then encrypts the files using RSA-2048 key (AES CBC 256-bit encryption algorithm) on the infected computer before displaying a message that instructs victims to download and install Tor browser; and visit the attacker's site for further instructions and payments.

This Locky Diablo6 variant demands a sum of 0.49 Bitcoin (over $2,079) from victims to get their files back.

Unfortunately, at this time it is impossible to recover the files encrypted by the .Diablo6 extension, so users need to exercise caution while opening email attachments.


Return of Disk-Encrypting Mamba Ransomware


Mamba is another powerful and dangerous kind of ransomware infection that encrypts the entire hard disk on an affected computer instead of just files, leaving the system totally unusable unless a ransom is paid.

Similar tactics have also been employed by other ransomware attacks, including Petya and WannaCry, but the Mamba ransomware has been designed for destruction in corporates and other large organisations, rather than extorting Bitcoins.

Late last year, Mamba infected the San Francisco's Municipal Transportation Agency (MUNI) system's network over the Thanksgiving weekend, causing major train delays and forcing officials to shut down ticket machines and fare gates at some stations.

Now, security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab have spotted a new campaign distributing Mamba infections, targeting corporate networks in countries, majorly in Brazil and Saudi Arabia.

Mamba is utilising a legitimate open source Windows disk encryption utility, called DiskCryptor, to fully lock up hard drives of computers in targeted organisations. So, there is no way to decrypt data as the encryption algorithms used by DiskCryptor are very strong.



Although it's not clear how the ransomware initially finds its way into a corporate network, researchers believe like most ransomware variants, Mamba might be using either an exploit kit on compromised or malicious sites or malicious attachments sent via an email.

The ransom note does not immediately demand money, rather the message displayed on the infected screen only claims that the victim's hard drive has been encrypted and offers two email addresses and a unique ID number to recover the key.


Here's How to Protect Yourself From Ransomware Attacks

Ransomware has become one of the largest threats to both individuals and enterprises with the last few months happening several widespread ransomware outbreaks.

Currently, there is no decryptor available to decrypt data locked by Mamba and Locky as well, so users are strongly advised to follow prevention measures in order to protect themselves.

Beware of Phishing emails: Always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent over an email and never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source.

Backup Regularly: To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC.

Keep your Antivirus software and system Up-to-date: Always keep your antivirus software and systems updated to protect against latest threats.

The popular cyber security and antivirus company<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>has unveiled its new hack-proof operating system: Kaspersky OS.

The new operating system has been in development for last 14 years and has chosen to design from scratch rather than relying on Linux.

Kaspersky OS makes its debut on a Kraftway Layer 3 Switch, CEO Eugene Kaspersky says in his blog post, without revealing many details about its new operating system.

The Layer of 3-switch is the very first tool for running the Kaspersky OS, which is designed for networks with extreme requirements for data security and aimed at critical infrastructure and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.


What's new in Kaspersky OS than others?

Kaspersky OS is based on Microkernel Architecture: The new secure OS is based on microkernel architecture that enables users to customize their own operating system accordingly.

So, depending on a user's specific requirements, Kaspersky OS can be designed by using different modifications blocks of the operating system.

Kaspersky OS is non-Linux: Yes, one of the three major distinctive features of the new OS mentioned by Kaspersky is that the GUI-less operating system has been constructed from scratch and does not contain "even the slightest smell of Linux."

"All the popular operating systems are not designed with security in mind, so it is simpler and safer to start from the ground up and do everything correctly. Which is just what we did," says Kaspersky.


But what makes Kaspersky OS Hack-Proof?

It is the operating system's inbuilt security system. Yes, Kaspersky OS inbuilt security system has the ability to control the behavior of applications and the OS modules.

Kaspersky OS claims itself as practically unhackable OS, because for gaining unauthorized access, any hacker would need to break the digital signature of an account holder, which is possible only with a quantum computer.

"In order to hack this platform a cyber-baddie would need to break the digital signature, which ‚Äì anytime before the introduction of quantum computers ‚Äì would be exorbitantly expensive," says Kaspersky.
Kaspersky talked about the recent DDoS attacks that affected numerous websites in past few months. He guaranteed that Kaspersky OS would protect devices, such as industrial control systems, SCADA or ICS, and IoTs, from cyber attacks.

The most severe one was the recent massive DDoS attack on Dyn's DNS servers, which knock down popular sites like Amazon and Twitter. The attack was carried out by Mirai botnets that had infected smart devices like security cameras.

So, Kaspersky says it is mandatory to protect the IoT and other critical infrastructure (like industry, transport, and telecoms) from IT threats.

"I also hope it's clear that it's better ‚Äì no matter how difficult ‚Äì to build IoT/infrastructure devices from the very beginning in such a way that hacking them is practically impossible. Indeed, that is a fundamental goal with Kaspersky OS," he says.
More details about Kaspersky's secure operating system is coming soon. Stay Tuned!

Security researchers at ESET have discovered a new malware campaign targeting consulates, ministries and embassies worldwide to spy on governments and diplomats.

Active since 2016, the malware campaign is leveraging a new backdoor, dubbed Gazer, and is believed to be carried out by Turla advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group that's been previously linked to Russian intelligence.

Gazer, written in C++, the backdoor delivers via spear phishing emails and hijacks targeted computers in two steps‚Äîfirst, the malware drops Skipper backdoor, which has previously been linked to Turla and then installs Gazer components.

In previous cyber espionage campaigns, the Turla hacking group used Carbon and Kazuar backdoors as its second-stage malware, which also has many similarities with Gazer, according to research [PDF] published by ESET.

Gazer receives encrypted commands from a remote command-and-control server and evades detection by using compromised, legitimate websites (that mostly use the WordPress CMS) as a proxy.


Instead of using Windows Crypto API, Gazer uses custom 3DES and RSA encryption libraries to encrypt the data before sending it to the C&C server‚Äîa common tactic employed by the Turla APT group.

Gazer uses code-injection technique to take control of a machine and hide itself for a long period of time in an attempt to steal information.

Gazer backdoor also has the ability to forward commands received by one infected endpoint to the other infected machines on the same network.

So far ESET researchers have identified four different variants of the Gazer malware in the wild, primarily spying on Southeast European and former Soviet bloc political targets.

Interestingly, earlier versions of Gazer were signed with a valid certificate issued by Comodo for "Solid Loop Ltd," while the latest version is signed with an SSL certificate issued to "Ultimate Computer Support Ltd."

According to researchers, Gazer has already managed to infect a number of targets worldwide, with the most victims being located in Europe.

Meanwhile,<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>lab has also published almost similar details about Gazer backdoor, but they called it 'Whitebear' APT campaign.

Hackers targeted at least 8 ATMs in Russia and stole $800,000 in a single night, but the method used by the intruders remained a complete mystery with CCTV footage just showing a lone culprit walking up to the ATM and collecting cash without even touching the machine.

Even the affected banks could not find any trace of malware on its ATMs or backend network or any sign of an intrusion. The only clue the unnamed bank's specialists found from the ATM's hard drive was ‚Äî two files containing malware logs.

The log files included the two process strings containing the phrases: "Take the Money Bitch!" and "Dispense Success."

This small clue was enough for the researchers from the Russian security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky,</span> who have been investigating the ATM heists, to find malware samples related to the ATM attack.

In February, Kaspersky Labs reported that attackers managed to hit over 140 enterprises, including banks, telecoms, and government organizations, in the US, Europe and elsewhere with the 'Fileless malware,' but provided few details about the attacks.

According to the researchers, the attacks against banks were carried out using a Fileless malware that resides solely in the memory (RAM) of the infected ATMs, rather than on the hard drive.

Now during the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit in St. Maarten on Monday, security researchers Sergey Golovanov and Igor Soumenkov delved into the ATM hacks that targeted two Russian banks, describing how the attackers used the fileless malware to gain a strong foothold into bank's systems and cash out, ThreatPost reports.


Mysterious ATM Hack Uncovered by Researchers


Dubbed ATMitch, the malware ‚Äî previously spotted in the wild in Kazakhstan and Russia ‚Äî is remotely installed and executed on ATMs via its remote administration module, which gives hackers the ability to form an SSH tunnel, deploy the malware, and then sending the command to the ATM to dispense cash.

Since Fileless malware uses the existing legitimate tools on a machine so that no malware gets installed on the system, the ATM treats the malicious code as legitimate software, allowing remote operators to send the command at the time when their associates are present on the infected ATM to pick up the money.

This ATM theft takes just a few seconds to be completed without the operator physically going near the machine. Once the ATM has been emptied, the operator 'signs off,' leaving a very little trace, if any, of the malware.

However, this remote attack is possible only if an attacker tunnels in through the bank's back-end network, a process which required far more sophisticated network intrusion skills.


A Very Precise Form of Physical Penetration

Since opening the ATM's panel directly could also trigger an alarm, attackers switched to a very precise form of physical penetration: Drilling a golf-ball sized hole in ATM's front panel to gain direct access to the cash dispenser panel using a serial distributed control (SDC RS485 standard) wire.

This method was revealed when Golovanov and Soumenkov were able to reverse engineer the ATM attack after police arrested a man dressed as a construction worker while he was drilling into an ATM to inject malicious commands in the middle of the day to trigger the machine‚Äôs cash dispenser.

The suspect was arrested with a laptop, cables, and a small box. Although the researchers did not name the affected ATM manufacturer or the banks, they warn that ATM burglars have already used the ATM drill attack across Russia and Europe.

In fact, this technique also affects ATMs around the world, leaving them vulnerable to having their cash drawn out in a matter of minutes.

Currently, the group or country behind these ATM hacks is unknown, but coding present in the attack contains references to the Russian language, and the tactics, techniques, and procedures bear a resemblance to those used by bank-robbing gangs Carbanak and GCMAN.

Fileless malware attacks are becoming more frequent. Just last month, researchers found a new fileless malware, dubbed DNSMessenger, that uses DNS queries to conduct malicious PowerShell commands on compromised computers, making the malware difficult to detect.

If you came across any Facebook message with a video link sent by anyone, even your friend ‚Äî just don‚Äôt click on it.

Security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab have spotted an ongoing cross-platform campaign on Facebook Messenger, where users receive a video link that redirects them to a fake website, luring them to install malicious software.


Although it is still unclear how the malware spreads, researchers believe spammers are using compromised accounts, hijacked browsers, or clickjacking techniques to spread the malicious link.

The attackers make use of social engineering to trick users into clicking the video link, which purports to be from one of their Facebook friends, with the message that reads "< your friend name > Video" followed by a bit.ly link, as shown.


Here's How this Cross-Platform Malware Works:


The URL redirects victims to a Google doc that displays a dynamically generated video thumbnail, like a playable movie, based on the sender's images, which if clicked, further redirects users to another customised landing page depending upon their browser and operating system.

For example, Mozilla Firefox users on Windows are redirected to a website displaying a fake Flash Player Update notice, and then offered a Windows executable, which is flagged as adware software.


Google Chrome users are redirected to a website that masquerades as YouTube with similar YouTube logo, which displays a fake error message popup, tricking victims into downloading a malicious Chrome extension from the Google Web Store.



The extension actually is a downloader that downloads a file of attacker's choice to the victim's computer.

"At the time of writing, the file which should have been downloaded was not available," David Jacoby, a chief security researcher from Kaspersky Lab, writes in a blog post published today.

"One interesting finding is that the Chrome Extension has log files from the developers displaying usernames. It is unclear if this is related to the campaign, but it is still an amusing piece of information."
Users of Apple Mac OS X Safari ends up on a web page similar to when using Firefox, but it was customised for MacOS users with a fake update for Flash Media Player, which if clicked, downloads an OSX executable .dmg file, which is also adware.

Same in case of Linux, user redirects to another landing page designed for Linux users.

The attackers behind the campaign are not actually infecting users of all platform with any banking Trojan or exploit kits, but with adware to make a lot of money by generating revenue from ads.

Spam campaigns on Facebook are quite common. A few years ago, researchers found cyber criminals using boobytrapped .JPG image files to hide their malware in order to infect Facebook users with variants of the Locky ransomware, which encrypts all files on the infected PC until a ransom is paid.

To keep yourself safe, you are advised not to get curious to look at images or video links sent by anyone, even your friend, without verifying it with them, and always keep your antivirus software up-to-date.

Yesterday WikiLeaks published thousands of documents revealing top CIA hacking secrets, including the agency's ability to break into iPhones, Android phones, smart TVs, and Microsoft, Mac and Linux operating systems.

It dubbed the first release as Vault 7.

Vault 7 is just the first part of leak series ‚ÄúYear Zero‚Äù that WikiLeaks will be releasing in coming days. Vault 7 is all about a covert global hacking operation being run by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

According to the whistleblower organization, the CIA did not inform the companies about the security issues of their products; instead held on to security bugs in software and devices, including iPhones, Android phones, and Samsung TVs, that millions of people around the world rely on.

One leaked document suggested that the CIA was even looking for tools to remotely control smart cars and trucks, allowing the agency to cause "accidents" which would effectively be "nearly undetectable assassinations."

While security experts, companies and non-profit organizations are still reviewing 8,761 documents released as Vault 7 archive, we are here with some relevant facts and points that you need to know.

Here's Everything You Need to Know About Vault 7:

WikiLeaks Exposes CIA's Mobile Hacking SecretsVault7 ‚Äî CIA has an impressive list of ways to hack into your iOS, Android & Windows phones.
CLICK TO TWEETVault 7 purportedly includes 8,761 documents and files that detail intelligence information on CIA-developed software intended to crack any Android smartphone or Apple iPhone, including some that could take full control of the devices.

In fact, Wikileaks alleges that the CIA has a sophisticated unit in its Mobile Development Branch that develops zero-day exploits and malware to "infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads."

Some of the attacks are powerful enough to allow an attacker to remotely take over the "kernel," the heart of the operating system that controls the smartphone operation, or to gain "root" access on the devices, giving the attacker access to information like geolocation, communications, contacts, and more.

These types of attacks would most likely be useful for targeted hacking, rather than mass surveillance.

The leaked documents also detail some specific attacks the agency can perform on certain smartphones models and operating systems, including recent versions of iOS and Android.

CIA Didn't Break Encryption Apps, Instead Bypassed ItVault7 ‚Äî CIA-made phone malware can read your private chats without breaking encryption.CLICK TO TWEETIn the hours since the documents were made available by WikiLeaks, a misconception was developed, making people believe the CIA "cracked" the encryption used by popular secure messaging software including Signal and WhatsApp.

WikiLeaks asserted that:
"These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloakman by hacking the "smart" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied."This statement by WikiLeaks made most people think that the encryption used by end-to-end encrypted messaging clients such as Signal and WhatsApp has been broken.

No, it hasn't.

Instead, the CIA has tools to gain access to entire phones, which would of course "bypass" encrypted messaging apps because it fails all other security systems virtually on the phone, granting total remote access to the agency.

The WikiLeaks documents do not show any attack particular against Signal or WhatsApp, but rather the agency hijacks the entire phone and listens in before the applications encrypt and transmit information.

It‚Äôs like you are sitting in a train next to the target and reading his 2-way text conversation on his phone or laptop while he's still typing, this doesn't mean that the security of the app the target is using has any issue.

In that case, it also doesn't matter if the messages were encrypted in transit if you are already watching everything that happens on the device before any security measure comes into play.

But this also doesn't mean that this makes the issue lighter, as noted by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, "This incorrectly implies CIA hacked these apps/encryption. But the docs show iOS/Android are what got hacked‚Äîa much bigger problem."

CIA Develops Malware to targets Windows, Linux & MacOSVault7 ‚Äî CIA also develops cross-platform malware to hack Windows, MacOS & Linux ComputersCLICK TO TWEETThe Wikileaks CIA dump also includes information about the malware that can be used by the agency to hack, remotely spy on and control PCs running Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

This apparently means that the CIA can bypass PGP email encryption and even Virtual Private Network (VPN) on your computer in a similar way. The agency can also see everything you are doing online, even if you are hiding it behind Tor Browser. 

Again, this also does not mean that using PGP, VPNs, or Tor Browser is not safe or that the CIA can hack into these services.

But the agency's ability to hack into any OS to gain full control of any device  ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a smartphone, a laptop, or a TV with a microphone ‚Äî makes the CIA capable of bypassing any service spy on everything that happens on that device.

CIA Borrowed Codes from Public Malware SamplesVault7 ‚Äî CIA uses codes from publicly available #malware samples to build its own spyware.CLICK TO TWEETYes, in addition to the attacks purportedly developed by the CIA, the agency has adopted some of the code from other, public sources of malware. Well, that's what many does.

One of the documents mentions how the agency supposedly tweaks bits of code from known malware samples to develop its custom code and more targeted solutions.

"The UMBRAGE team maintains a library of application development techniques borrowed from in-the-wild malware," the WikiLeaks document reads. "The goal of this repository is to provide functional code snippets that can be rapidly combined into custom solutions."
Some of the exploits listed were discovered and released by security firms, hacker groups, independent researchers, and purchased, or otherwise acquired by the CIA from other intelligence agencies, such as the FBI, NSA, and GCHQ.

One borrowed exploit in "Data Destruction Components" includes a reference to Shamoon, a nasty malware that has the capability to steal data and then completely wipe out hard-drives.

Another acquired attack by the CIA is SwampMonkey, which allows the agency to get root privileges on undisclosed Android devices.

Persistence, another tool in the CIA arsenal, allows the agency to gain control over the target device whenever it boots up again.

CIA Used Malware-Laced Apps to Spy on TargetsVault7 ‚Äî Fine Dining Attack: CIA used #malware-laced apps to spy on its targets.CLICK TO TWEETThe leaked documents include a file, named "Fine Dining," which does not contain any list of zero-day exploits or vulnerabilities, but a collection of malware-laced applications.

Fine Dining is a highly versatile technique which can be configured for a broad range of deployment scenarios, as it is meant for situations where the CIA agent has to infect a computer physically.

CIA field agents store one or more of these infected applications -- depending upon their targets -- on a USB, which they insert in their target's system to run one of the applications to gather the data from the device.

Developed by OSB (Operational Support Branch), a division of the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, Fine Dining includes modules that can be used to weaponize following applications:

The CIA's Desperation To Crack Apple's EncryptionVault7 ‚Äî CIA has desperately been working for years to break Apple's Encryption.CLICK TO TWEETThis is not the first time when the CIA has been caught targeting iOS devices. It was previously disclosed that the CIA was targeting Apple's iPhones and iPads, following the revelation of top-secret documents from the agency's internal wiki system in 2015 from the Snowden leaks.

The documents described that the CIA had been "targeting essential security keys used to encrypt data stored on Apple's devices" by using both "physical" and "non-invasive" techniques.

In addition to the CIA, the FBI hacking division Remote Operations Unit has also been working desperately to discover exploits in iPhones, one of the WikiLeaks documents indicates.

That could also be the reason behind the agency's effort to force Apple into developing a working exploit to hack into the iPhone belonging to one of the terrorists in the San Bernardino case.

Apple Says It Has Already Patched Most Flaws Documented in CIA LeakVault7 ‚Äî Apple says it has already patched many iOS vulnerabilities revealed in CIA Leaks.CLICK TO TWEETBesides vulnerabilities in Android and Samsung Smart TVs, the leaked documents detail 14 iOS exploits, describing how the agency uses these security issues to track users, monitor their communications, and even take complete control of their phones.

However, Apple is pushing back against claims that the CIA's stored bugs for its devices were effective.

According to Apple, many iOS exploits in the Wikileaks CIA document dump have already been patched in its latest iOS version, released in January, while Apple engineers continue to work to address any new vulnerabilities that were known to the CIA.

Here's the statement provided by an Apple spokesperson:
"Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers‚Äô privacy and security. The technology built into today‚Äôs iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we‚Äôre constantly working to keep it that way. Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80 percent of users running the latest version of our operating system. While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates."Hacking 'Anyone, Anywhere,' Thanks to Internet Of 'Insecure' ThingsVault7 ‚Äî CIA can hack your Smart TV and other smart devices to spy on you.CLICK TO TWEETBesides hundreds of exploits, zero-days, and hacking tools that targets a large number of software and services, Vault 7 also includes details about a surveillance technique ‚Äî codenamed Weeping Angel ‚Äî used by the CIA to infiltrate smart TVs.

Samsung smart TVs are found to be vulnerable to Weeping Angel hacks that place the TVs into a "Fake-Off" mode, in which the owner believes the TV is off when it is actually on, allowing the CIA to covertly record conversations "in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server."

"Weeping Angel already hooks key presses from the remote (or TV goes to sleep) to cause the system to enter Fake-Off rather than Off," the leaked CIA document reads. "Since the implant is already hooking these events, the implant knows when the TV will be entering Fake-Off mode."

In response to the WikiLeaks CIA documents, Samsung released a statement that reads: "Protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung. We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter."

WikiLeaks' CIA Leak Isn't Bigger than Snowden's NSA LeaksThe CIA isn't more advanced than the NSA TAO Team and Vault 7 leak isn‚Äôt even bigger than Snowden .CLICK TO TWEETWikiLeaks claims the massive CIA hacking leak is larger than the Edward Snowden revelations about NSA's hacking and surveillance programs, but it is much much smaller.

While the Snowden revelations disclosed the global covert surveillance through text, the voice of people using hacking tools that permitted mass data gathering and analysis, the CIA data dump so far just shows that the CIA gathered and purchased tools that could be used to target individual devices.

However, there is no evidence of mass surveillance of smartphones or computers in the leaked documents. Technologically, the NSA is much more forward in sophistication and technical expertise than the CIA.
Ex-CIA Chief Says Wikileaks dump has made US 'less safe'Vault7 ‚Äî Ex-CIA Chief says CIA files leaked by Wikileaks is incredibly damaging and has put lives at risk.CLICK TO TWEETFormer CIA boss Michael Hayden said the latest leak of highly sensitive CIA documents and files by Wikileaks is "incredibly damaging" and has put lives at risk, BBC reports, while the CIA has not yet commented on the leaks.

The CIA revelations by the whistleblower organization are just beginning. People will see more revelations about the government and agencies from the WikiLeaks in coming days as part of its Year Zero leaks.

The group of unknown hackers who hijacked CCleaner's download server to distribute a malicious version of the popular system optimization software targeted at least 20 major international technology companies with a second-stage payload.

Earlier this week, when the CCleaner hack was reported, researchers assured users that there's no second stage malware used in the massive attack and affected users can simply update their version in order to get rid of the malicious software.

However, during the analysis of the hackers' command-and-control (C2) server to which the malicious CCleaner versions connected, security researchers from Cisco's Talos Group found evidence of a second payload (GeeSetup_x86.dll, a lightweight backdoor module) that was delivered to a specific list of computers based on local domain names.


Affected Technology Firms¬†

According to a predefined list mentioned in the configuration of the C2 server, the attack was designed to find computers inside the networks of the major technology firms and deliver the secondary payload. The target companies included:

Google
Microsoft
Cisco
Intel
Samsung
Sony
HTC
Linksys
D-Link
Akamai
VMware

In the database, researchers found a list of nearly 700,000 backdoored machines infected with the malicious version of CCleaner, i.e. the first-stage payload, and a list of at least 20 machines that were infected with the secondary payload to get a deeper foothold on those systems.

The CCleaner hackers specifically chose these 20 machines based upon their Domain name, IP address, and Hostname. The researchers believe the secondary malware was likely intended for industrial espionage.


CCleaner Malware Links to Chinese Hacking Group

According to the researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky,</span> the CCleaner malware shares some code with the hacking tools used by a sophisticated Chinese hacking group called Axiom, also known as APT17, Group 72, DeputyDog, Tailgater Team, Hidden Lynx or AuroraPanda.

"The malware injected into #CCleaner has shared code with several tools used by one of the APT groups from the #Axiom APT 'umbrella'," tweeted director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab.
Cisco researchers also note that one configuration file on the attacker's server was set for China's time zone, which suggests China could be the source of the CCleaner attack. However, this evidence alone is not enough for attribution.

Cisco Talos researchers also said that they have already notified the affected tech companies about a possible breach.


Removing Malicious CCleaner Version would Not Help

Just removing the Avast's software application from the infected machines would not be enough to get rid of the CCleaner second stage malware payload from their network, with the attackers' still-active C2 server.

So, affected companies that have had their computers infected with the malicious version of CCleaner are strongly recommended to fully restore their systems from backup versions before the installation of the tainted security program.

"These findings also support and reinforce our previous recommendation that those impacted by this supply chain attack should not simply remove the affected version of CCleaner or update to the latest version, but should restore from backups or reimage systems to ensure that they completely remove not only the backdoored version of CCleaner but also any other malware that may be resident on the system," the researchers say.
For those who are unaware, the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware, and affected users should update the software to version 5.34 or higher.

It‚Äôs been almost four weeks since the outcry of WannaCry ransomware, but the hackers behind the self-spread ransomware threat have not been identified yet.

However, two weeks ago researchers at Google,<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, Intezer and Symantec linked WannaCry to ‚ÄòLazarus Group,‚Äô a state-sponsored hacking group believed to work for the North Korean government.

Now, new research from dark web intelligence firm Flashpoint indicates the perpetrators may be Chinese, based on its own linguistic analysis.

Flashpoint researchers Jon Condra and John Costello analyzed each of WannaCry's localized ransom notes, which is available in 28 languages, for content, accuracy, and style, and discovered that all the notes, except English and Chinese versions (Simplified and Traditional), had been translated via Google Translate.

According to the research, Chinese and English versions of the ransomware notes were most likely written by a human.

On further analysis, researchers discovered that the English ransom note contains a "glaring" grammatical error, which suggests the ransomware author may be a non-native English speaker.


‚ÄúThough the English note appears to be written by someone with a strong command of English, a glaring grammatical error in the note suggest the speaker is non-native or perhaps poorly educated.‚Äù

And since Google Translate does not work good at translating Chinese to English and English to Chinese, and often produces inaccurate results, the English version could be written for translating the ransom note into other languages.



‚ÄúComparisons between the Google translated versions of the English ransomware note to the corresponding WannaCry ransom note yielded nearly identical results, producing a 96% or above match.‚Äù

According to the Flashpoint report, the Chinese ransom notes contain "substantial content not present in any other version of the note," and they are longer than and formatted differently from the English one.

The Chinese ransom notes also use proper grammar, punctuation, syntax, and character choice ‚Äì indicating that the ransomware writer is fluent in the Chinese language.


"A typo in the note, bang zu (Âπ´ÁµÑ) instead of bang zhu (Âπ´Âä©), which means ‚Äòhelp,' strongly indicates the note was written using a Chinese-language input system rather than being translated from a different version," the researchers explain.


"The text uses certain terms that further narrow down a geographic location. One term, libai ( Á¶ÆÊãú ) for ‚Äòweek,‚Äô is more common in southern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore...The other ‚ÄúÊùÄÊØíËΩØ‰ª∂‚Äù for ‚Äúanti-virus‚Äù is more common in the Chinese mainland."

All these clues made Flashpoint researchers into believing with high confidence that the unknown author or authors of WannaCry ransomware are fluent Chinese speaker and that the Chinese are the source of the English version of the ransom note.

However, Flashpoint researchers say it's hard to speculate the nationality of the WannaCry hackers as they may be affiliated to any Asian (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Singapore).

WannaCry epidemic hit more than 300,000 PCs in more than 150 countries within just 72 hours, using self-spreading capabilities to infect vulnerable Windows PCs, particularly those using older versions of the operating system.

While most of the affected organisations have now returned to normal, law enforcement agencies across the world are on the hunt.

Another day, another creepy malware for Android users!

Security Researchers have uncovered a new Android malware targeting your devices, but this time instead of attacking the device directly, the malware takes control over the WiFi router to which your device is connected to and then hijacks the web traffic passing through it.

Dubbed "Switcher," the new Android malware, discovered by researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, hacks the wireless routers and changes their DNS settings to redirect traffic to malicious websites.

Over a week ago, Proofpoint researchers discovered similar attack targeting PCs, but instead of infecting the target's machines, the Stegano exploit kit takes control over the local WiFi routers the infected device is connected to.


Switcher Malware carries out Brute-Force attack against Routers

Hackers are currently distributing the Switcher trojan by disguising itself as an Android app for the Chinese search engine Baidu (com.baidu.com), and as a Chinese app for sharing public and private Wi-Fi network details (com.snda.wifilocating).

Once victim installs one of these malicious apps, the Switcher malware attempts to log in to the WiFi router the victim's Android device is connected to by carrying out a brute-force attack on the router's admin web interface with a set of a predefined dictionary (list) of usernames and passwords.

"With the help of JavaScript [Switcher] tries to login using different combinations of logins and passwords," mobile security expert Nikita Buchka of Kaspersky Lab says in a blog post published today.¬†

"Judging by the hard coded names of input fields and the structures of the HTML documents that the trojan tries to access, the JavaScript code used will work only on web interfaces of TP-LINK Wi-Fi routers."

Switcher Malware Infects Routers via DNS Hijacking


Once accessed web administration interface, the Switcher trojan replaces the router's primary and secondary DNS servers with IP addresses pointing to malicious DNS servers controlled by the attackers.

Researchers said Switcher had used three different IP addresses ‚Äì 101.200.147.153, 112.33.13.11 and 120.76.249.59 ‚Äì as the primary DNS record, one is the default one while the other two are set for specific internet service providers.

Due to change in router's DNS settings, all the traffic gets redirected to malicious websites hosted on attackers own servers, instead of the legitimate site the victim is trying to access.

"The Trojan targets the entire network, exposing all its users, whether individuals or businesses, to a wide range of attacks ‚Äì from phishing to secondary infection," the post reads.

"A successful attack can be hard to detect and even harder to shift: the new settings can survive a router reboot, and even if the rogue DNS is disabled, the secondary DNS server is on hand to carry on."
Researchers were able to access the attacker‚Äôs command and control servers and found that the Switcher malware Trojan has compromised almost 1,300 routers, mainly in China and hijacked traffic within those networks.


The Bottom Line

Android users are required to download applications only from official Google's Play Store.

While downloading apps from third parties do not always end up with malware or viruses, it certainly ups the risk. So, it is the best way to avoid any malware compromising your device and the networks it accesses.

You can also go to Settings ‚Üí Security and make sure "Unknown sources" option is turned off.

Moreover, Android users should also change their router's default login and passwords so that nasty malware like Switcher or Mirai, can not compromise their routers using a brute-force attack.

Mirai Botnet is getting stronger and more notorious each day that passes by. The reason: Insecure Internet-of-things Devices.

Last month, the Mirai botnet knocked the entire Internet offline for a few hours, crippling some of the world's biggest and most popular websites.

Now, more than 900,000 broadband routers belonging to Deutsche Telekom users in Germany knocked offline over the weekend following a supposed cyber-attack, affecting the telephony, television, and internet service in the country.

The German Internet Service Provider, Deutsche Telekom, which offers various services to around 20 Million customers, confirmed on Facebook that as many as 900,000 customers suffered internet outages on Sunday and Monday.

Millions of routers are said to have vulnerable to a critical Remote code Execution flaw in routers made by Zyxel and Speedport, wherein Internet port 7547 open to receive commands based on the TR-069 and related TR-064 protocols, which are meant to use by ISPs to manage your devices remotely.

The same vulnerability affects Eir D1000 wireless routers (rebranded Zyxel Modem) deployed by Irish internet service provider Eircom, while there are no signs that these routers are actively exploited.

According to Shodan search, around 41 Million devices leave port 7547 open, while about 5 Million expose TR-064 services to the outside world.

According to an advisory published by the SANS Internet Storm Center, honeypot servers posing as vulnerable routers are receiving exploit code every 5-10 minutes for each target IP.

An intercepted packet showed how a remote code execution flaw in the <NewNTPServer> part of a SOAP request was used to download and execute a file in order to infect the vulnerable device.

Security researchers at BadCyber also analyzed one of the malicious payloads that were delivered during the attacks and discovered that the attack originated from a known Mirai's command-and-control server.

"The unusual application of TR-064 commands to execute code on routers has been described for the very first time at the beginning of November, and a few days later a relevant Metasploit module had appeared," BadCyber wrote in a blog post. "It looks like someone decided to weaponize it and create an Internet worm based on Mirai code."
It all started early October when a cyber criminal publicly released the source code of Mirai, a piece of nasty IoT malware designed to scan for insecure IoT devices ‚Äì mostly routers, cameras, and DVRs ‚Äì and enslaves them into a botnet network, which is then used to launch DDoS attacks.

The hacker created three separate exploit files in order to infect three different architectures: two running different types of MIPS chips and one with ARM silicon. 

The malicious payloads open the remote administration interface and then attempt to log in using three different default passwords. After this is done, the exploit then closes port 7547 in order to prevent other attackers from taking control of the infected devices.

"Logins and passwords are obfuscated (or "encrypted") in the worm code using the same algorithm as does Mirai," the researchers say. "The C&C server resides under timeserver.host domain name, which can be found on the Mirai tracker list."

More in-depth technical details about the vulnerability can be found on ISC Sans,<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, and Reverse Engineering Blog.


Deutsche Telekom has issued an emergency patch for two models of its Speedport broadband routers ‚Äì Speedport W 921V, Speedport W 723V Type B ‚Äì and currently rolling out firmware updates. 

The company recommends its customers to power down their routers, wait for 30 seconds and then restart their routers in an attempt to fetch the new firmware during the bootup process. 

If the router fails to connect to the company's network, users are advised to disconnect their device from the network permanently.

To compensate the downtime, the ISP is also offering free Internet access through mobile devices to the affected customers until the technical problem is resolved.

Update ‚Äî¬†After reading this article, if you want to know, what has happened so far in past 4 days and how to protect your computers from WannaCry, read our latest article "WannaCry Ransomware: Everything You Need To Know Immediately."¬†

If you are following the news, by now you might be aware that a security researcher has activated a "Kill Switch" which apparently stopped the WannaCry ransomware from spreading further.

But it's not true, neither the threat is over yet.

However, the kill switch has just slowed down the infection rate.

Updated:¬†Multiple security researchers have claimed that there are more samples of WannaCry out there, with different 'kill-switch' domains and without any kill-switch function, continuing to infect unpatched computers worldwide (find more details below).

So far, over 237,000 computers across 99 countries around the world have been infected, and the infection is still rising even hours after the kill switch was triggered by the 22-years-old British security researcher behind the twitter handle 'MalwareTech.'

Also Read ‚Äî¬†Google Researcher Finds Link Between WannaCry Attacks and North Korea.

For those unaware, WannaCry is an insanely fast-spreading ransomware malware that leverages a Windows SMB exploit to remotely target a computer running on unpatched or unsupported versions of Windows.


So far, Criminals behind WannaCry Ransomware have received nearly 100 payments from victims, total 15 Bitcoins, equals to USD $26,090.

Once infected, WannaCry also scans for other vulnerable computers connected to the same network, as well scans random hosts on the wider Internet, to spread quickly.

The SMB exploit, currently being used by WannaCry, has been identified as EternalBlue, a collection of hacking tools allegedly created by the NSA and then subsequently dumped by a hacking group calling itself "The Shadow Brokers" over a month ago.

"If NSA had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they *found* it, not when they lost it, this may not have happened," NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden says.

Kill-Switch for WannaCry? No, It's not over yet!


In our previous two articles, we have put together more information about this massive ransomware campaign, explaining how MalwareTech accidentally halted the global spread of WannaCry by registering a domain name hidden in the malware.

hxxp://www[.]iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com
The above-mentioned domain is responsible for keeping WannaCry propagating and spreading like a worm, as I previously explained that if the connection to this domain fails, the SMB worm proceeds to infect the system.

Fortunately, MalwareTech registered this domain in question and created a sinkhole ‚Äì tactic researchers use to redirect traffic from the infected machines to a self-controlled system. (read his latest blog post for more details)

Updated: Matthieu Suiche, a security researcher, has confirmed that he has found a new WannaCry variant with a different domain for kill-switch function, which he registered to redirect it to a sinkhole in an effort to slows down the infections.

hxxp://ifferfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea[.]com/
The newly discovered WannaCry variant works exactly like the previous variant that wreaked havoc across the world Friday night.

But, if you are thinking that activating the kill switch has completely stopped the infection, then you are mistaken.

Since the kill-switch feature was in the SMB worm, not in the ransomware module itself., "WannaCrypt ransomware was spread normally long before this and will be long after, what we stopped was the SMB worm variant," MalwareTech told The Hacker News.
You should know that the kill-switch would not prevent your unpatched PC from getting infected, in the following scenarios:

If you receive WannaCry via an email, a malicious torrent, or other vectors (instead of SMB protocol).
If by chance your ISP or antivirus or firewall blocks access to the sinkhole domain.
If the targeted system requires a proxy to access the Internet, which is a common practice in the majority of corporate networks.
If someone makes the sinkhole domain inaccessible for all, such as by using a large-scale DDoS attack.

MalwareTech also confirmed THN that some "Mirai botnet skids tried to DDoS the [sinkhole] server for lulz," in order to make it unavailable for WannaCry SMB exploit, which triggers infection if the connection fails. But "it failed hardcore," at least for now.


WannaCry 2.0, Ransomware With *NO* Kill-Switch Is On Hunt!


CIRCL c/o securitymadein.lu

Initially, this part of story was based on research of a security researcher, who earlier claimed to have the samples of new WannaCry ransomware that comes with no kill-switch function. But for some reason, he backed off. So, we have removed his references from this story for now.

However, shortly after that, we were confirmed by Costin Raiu, the director of global research and analysis team at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Labs, that his team had seen more WannaCry samples on Friday that did not have the kill switch.

"I can confirm we've had versions without the kill switch domain connect since yesterday," told The Hacker News.

Updated:¬†WannaCry 2.0 is Someone Else's Work

 Raiu from Kaspersky shared some samples, his team discovered, with Suiche, who analysed them and just confirmed that there is a WannaCrypt variant without kill switch, and equipped with SMB exploit that would help it to spread rapidly without disruption.

What's even worse is that the new WannaCry variant without a kill-switch believed to be created by someone else, and not the hackers behind the initial WannaCry ransomware.

"The patched version matt described does attempt to spread. It's a full set which was modified by someone with a hex editor to disable the kill switch," Raiu told me.
Updated: However, Suiche also confirmed that the modified variant with no kill switch is corrupted, but this doesn't mean that other hackers and criminals would not come up with a working one.

"Given the high profile of the original attack, it's going to be no surprise at all to see copycat attacks from others, and perhaps other attempts to infect even more computers from the original WannaCry gang. The message is simple: Patch your computers, harden your defences, run a decent anti-virus, and - for goodness sake - ensure that you have secure backups."¬†Cyber security expert Graham Cluley told The Hacker News.
Expect a new wave of ransomware attack, by initial attackers and new ones, which would be difficult to stop, until and unless all vulnerable systems get patched.

"The next attacks are inevitable, you can simply patch the existing samples with a hex editor and it'll continue to spread," Matthew Hickey, a security expert and co-founder of Hacker House told me.¬†

"We will see a number of variants of this attack over the coming weeks and months so it's important to patch hosts. The worm can be modified to spread other payloads not just WCry and we may see other malware campaigns piggybacking off this samples success."
Even after WannaCry attacks made headlines all over the Internet and Media, there are still hundreds of thousands of unpatched systems out there that are open to the Internet and vulnerable to hacking.

"The worm functionality attempts to infect unpatched Windows machines in the local network. At the same time, it also executes massive scanning on Internet IP addresses to find and infect other vulnerable computers. This activity results in large SMB traffic from the infected host," Microsoft says.
Believe me, the new strain of WannaCry 2.0 malware would not take enough time to take over another hundred¬†of thousand vulnerable systems.


Video Demo of WannaCry Ransomware Infection

Hickey has also provided us two video demonstrations, showing packet traces that confirm the use of Windows SMB vulnerability (MS17-010).





 And Second one‚Ä¶




Since¬†WannaCry is a single executable file, it can also be spread through other regular exploit vectors, such as spear phishing, drive-by-download attack, and malicious torrent files download, warned Hickey.


Get Prepared: Upgrade, Patch OS & Disable SMBv1

MalwareTech also warned of the future threat, saying "It's very important [for] everyone [to] understand that all they [the attackers] need to do is change some code and start again. Patch your systems now!"

"Informed NCSC, FBI, etc. I've done as much as I can do currently, it's up to everyone to patch," he added.

As we notified today, Microsoft took an unusual step to protect its customers with an unsupported version of Windows ‚Äî including Windows XP, Vista, Windows 8, Server 2003 and 2008 ‚Äî by releasing security patches that fix SMB flaw currently being exploited by the WannaCry ransomware.

Even after this, I believe, many individuals remain unaware of the new patches and many organizations, as well as embedded machines like ATM and digital billboard displays, running on older or unpatched versions of Windows, who are considering to upgrade their operating system, would take time as well as it‚Äôs going to cost them money for getting new licenses.

So, users and organizations are strongly advised to install available Windows patches as soon as possible, and also consider disabling SMBv1 (follow these steps), to prevent similar future cyber attacks.

For god sake: Apply Patches. Microsoft has been very generous to you.

Almost all antivirus vendors have already been added signatures to protect against this latest threat. Make sure you are using a good antivirus, and keep it always up-to-date.

Moreover, you can also follow some basic security practices I have listed to protect yourself from such malware threats.


WannaCry has Hit Over 200,000 Systems in 150 Countries, Warned Europol


Update:¬†Speaking to Britain's ITV, Europol chief Rob Wainwright said the whole world is facing an "escalating threat," warning people that the numbers are going up and that they should ensure the security of their systems is up to date.

"We are running around 200 global operations against cyber crime each year, but we've never seen anything like this," Wainwright said, as quoted by BBC.¬†

"The latest count is over 200,000 victims in at least 150 countries. Many of those victims will be businesses, including large corporations. The global reach is unprecedented."

Cyber criminals are becoming more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day. They are now adopting more clandestine techniques that come with limitless attack vectors and are harder to detect.

Recently, cyber crooks managed to infiltrate the update mechanism for a popular server management software package and altered it to include an advanced backdoor, which lasts for at least 17 days until researchers discovered it.

Dubbed ShadowPad, the secret backdoor gave attackers complete control over networks hidden behind legit cryptographically signed software sold by NetSarang‚Äîused by hundreds of banks, media firms, energy companies, and pharmaceutical firms, telecommunication providers, transportation and logistics and other industries‚Äîfor 17 days starting last month.

Important Note ‚Äî If you are using any of the affected product (listed below), we highly recommend you stop using it until you update them.


Hacker Injected Backdoor¬†Through Software Update Mechanism

According to researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Labs, who discovered this well-hidden backdoor, someone managed to hijack the NetSarang's update mechanism and silently insert the backdoor in the software update, so that the malicious code would silently deliver to all of its clients with NetSarang's legitimate signed certificate.

The attackers of the Petya/NotPetya ransomware that infected computers around the world in June used the same tactic by compromising the update mechanism for Ukrainian financial software provider called MeDoc and swapped in a dodgy update including NotPetya.

"ShadowPad is an example of the dangers posed by a successful supply-chain attack," Kaspersky Lab researchers said in their blog post published Tuesday. "Given the opportunities for covert data collection, attackers are likely to pursue this type of attack again and again with other widely used software components."
The secret backdoor was located in the nssock2.dll library within NetSarang's Xmanager and Xshell software suites that went live on the NetSarang website on July 18.

However, Kaspersky Labs researchers discovered the backdoor and privately reported it to the company on August 4, and NetSarang immediately took action by pulling down the compromised software suite from its website and replacing it with a previous clean version.

The affected NetSarang's software packages are:

Xmanager Enterprise 5.0 Build 1232
Xmanager 5.0 Build 1045
Xshell 5.0 Build 1322
Xftp 5.0 Build 1218
Xlpd 5.0 Build 1220



Hackers Can Remotely Trigger Commands

The attackers hide the ShadowPad backdoor code in several layers of encrypted code that were decrypted only in intended cases.

"The tiered architecture prevents the actual business logics of the backdoor from being activated until a special packet is received from the first tier command and control (C&C) server (activation C&C server)," the researchers wrote.
Until then, the backdoor pings out every 8 hours to a command-and-control server with basic information on the compromised computers, including their domain names, network details, and usernames.


Here's how the attackers activate the backdoor:

The activation of the backdoor was eventually triggered by a specially crafted DNS TXT record for a specific domain name. The domain name is generated based on the current month and year, and performs a DNS lookup on it.

Once triggered, the command and control DNS server in return sends back the decryption key which is downloaded by the software for the next stage of the code, effectively activating the backdoor.

Once activated, the ShadowPad backdoor provides a full backdoor for an attacker to download and run arbitrary code, create processes, and maintain a virtual file system (VFS) in the registry, which is encrypted and stored in locations unique to each victim.

Kaspersky researchers said they could confirm activated backdoor in one case, against an unnamed company located in Hong Kong.


How to Detect this Backdoor and Protect Your Company

The company has rolled out an update to kill the malicious software on August 4, and is investigating how the backdoor code got into its software.

Anyone who has not updated their NetSarang software since then is highly recommended to upgrade to the latest version of the NetSarang package immediately to protect against any threats.

Additionally, check if there were DNS requests from your organization to the following list of domains. If yes, the requests to those domains should be blocked.

	      StoneDrill Disk Wiping Malware Found Targeting European Industries [1.05 Points on average]

A new disk wiping malware has been uncovered targeting a petroleum company in Europe, which is quite similar to the mysterious disk wiper malware Shamoon that wiped data from 35,000 computers at Saudi Arabia's national oil company in 2012.

Disk wiping malware has the ability to cripple any organization by permanently wiping out data from all hard drive and external storage on a targeted machine, causing great financial and reputational damage.

Security researchers from Moscow-based antivirus provider<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab discovered the new wiper StoneDrill while researching last November's re-emergence of Shamoon malware (Shamoon 2.0) attacks ‚Äì two attacks occurred in November and one in late January.

Shamoon 2.0 is the more advanced version of Shamoon malware that reportedly hit 15 government agencies and organizations across the world, wipes data and takes control of the computer‚Äôs boot record, preventing the computers from being turned back on.

Meanwhile, Kaspersky researchers found that the newly discovered StoneDrill wiper malware was built in a similar "style" to Shamoon 2.0, but did not share the exact same code base.

"The discovery of the StoneDrill wiper in Europe is a significant sign that the group is expanding its destructive attacks outside the Middle East," Kaspersky researchers say in a blog post. "The target for the attack appears to be a large corporation with a wide area of activity in the petrochemical sector, with no apparent connection or interest in Saudi Arabia."
Researchers also noticed that the samples of Shamoon 2.0 and StoneDrill were also uploaded multiple times to online multi-scanner antivirus engines from Saudi Arabia last November.


Here's How StoneDrill Malware Works:


StoneDrill has been designed to as a service and target all systems connected within an organization to a Windows domain. In order to spread itself, the malware relies on a list of hard coded, previously stolen usernames and passwords belonging to administrators of the targeted domain.

Once infected, StoneDrill automatically generates a custom wiper malware module without connecting to any command-and-control server, rendering the infected machines completely inoperable.

StoneDrill wiper malware also includes the following characteristics:


New Evasion Techniques
StoneDrill features an impressive ability to evade detection and avoid sandbox execution. Unlike Shamoon, StoneDrill doesn't make use of disk drivers during installation.

Instead, StoneDrill relies on memory injection of the data wiping module into the victim's preferred browser.

StoneDrill also makes use of Visual Basic Scripts to run self-delete scripts, while Shamoon did not use any external scripts.


Backdoor Ability
Like Shamoon, StoneDrill also includes backdoor functions that are used for espionage operations, with screenshot and upload capabilities.

Kaspersky researchers identified at least four command-and-control (C&C) servers that the attackers used to spy on and steal data from an unknown number of targets. 

Furthermore, StoneDrill uses command and control communications to interact with the malware instead of using a "kill time" as in the Shamoon attacks analyzed in January 2017 that do not implement any C&C communication.


Ransomware Component

Besides wiping functionality, the new malware also includes a ransomware component.

However, this feature is currently inactive but attackers can use leverage this part of the platform in future attacks to hold victims hostage for financial or idealistic gain.

Like Shamoon 2.0, StoneDrill was reportedly compiled in October and November 2016. 

Although StoneDrill mostly targets organizations in Saudi Arabia, Kaspersky researchers discovered the malware victims in Europe as well, meaning that the attackers might be widening their campaign.

For more technical details about the StoneDrill and Shamoon 2.0 attacks, you can head on to Kaspersky's official blog.

Security researchers have recently uncovered a cyber espionage group targeting aerospace, defence and energy organisations in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.

According to the latest research published Wednesday by US security firm FireEye, an Iranian hacking group that it calls Advanced Persistent Threat 33 (or APT33) has been targeting critical infrastructure, energy and military sectors since at least 2013 as part of a massive cyber-espionage operation to gather intelligence and steal trade secrets.

The security firm also says it has evidence that APT33 works on behalf of Iran's government.

FireEye researchers have spotted cyber attacks aimed by APT33 since at least May 2016 and found that the group has successfully targeted aviation sector‚Äîboth military and commercial‚Äîas well as organisations in the energy sector with a link to petrochemical.

The APT33 victims include a U.S. firm in the aerospace sector, a Saudi Arabian business conglomerate with aviation holdings, and a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals.

Most recently, in May 2017, APT33 targeted employees of a Saudi organisation and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice them with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company.

"We believe the targeting of the Saudi organisation may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea‚Äôs recent partnerships with Iran‚Äôs petrochemical industry as well as South Korea‚Äôs relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies," the FireEye report reads.

APT33 targets organisations by sending spear phishing emails with malicious HTML links to infect targets' computers with malware. The malware used by the espionage group includes DROPSHOT (dropper), SHAPESHIFT (wiper) and TURNEDUP (custom backdoor, which is the final payload).

However, in previous research published by<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky,</span> DROPSHOT was tracked by its researchers as StoneDrill, which targeted petroleum company in Europe and believed to be an updated version of Shamoon 2 malware.


"Although we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP backdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT," the report reads.

The SHAPESHIFT malware can wipe disks, erase volumes and delete files, depending on its configuration.

According to FireEye, APT 33 sent hundreds of spear phishing emails last year from several domains, which masqueraded as Saudi aviation companies and international organisations, including Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia.

The security firm also believes APT 33 is linked to Nasr Institute, an Iranian government organisation that conducts cyber warfare operations.

In July, researchers at Trend Micro and Israeli firm ClearSky uncovered another Iranian espionage group, dubbed Rocket Kittens, that was also active since 2013 and targeted organisations and individuals, including diplomats and researchers, in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and Germany.

However, FireEye report does not show any links between both the hacking group. For more technical details about the APT33 operations, you can head on to FireEye's official blog post.

Update ‚Äî¬†After reading this article, if you want to know, what has happened so far in past 4 days and how to protect your computers from WannaCry, read our latest article "WannaCry Ransomware: Everything You Need To Know Immediately."¬†

Earlier today, a massive ransomware campaign hit computer systems of hundreds of private companies and public organizations across the globe ‚Äì which is believed to be the most massive ransomware delivery campaign to date.

The Ransomware in question has been identified as a variant of ransomware known as WannaCry (also known as 'Wana Decrypt0r,' 'WannaCryptor' or 'WCRY').

Like other nasty ransomware variants, WannaCry also blocks access to a computer or its files and demands money to unlock it.

Once infected with the WannaCry ransomware, victims are asked to pay up to $300 in order to remove the infection from their PCs; otherwise, their PCs render unusable, and their files remain locked.

In separate news, researchers have also discovered a massive malicious email campaign that's spreading the Jaff ransomware at the rate of 5 million emails per hour and hitting computers across the globe.


Ransomware Using NSA's Exploit to Spread Rapidly

What's interesting about this ransomware is that WannaCry attackers are leveraging a Windows exploit harvested from the NSA called EternalBlue, which was dumped by the Shadow Brokers hacking group over a month ago.

Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability in March (MS17-010), but many users and organizations who did not patch their systems are open to attacks.

The exploit has the capability to penetrate into machines running unpatched version of Windows XP through 2008 R2 by exploiting flaws in Microsoft Windows SMB Server. This is why WannaCry campaign is spreading at an astonishing pace.

Once a single computer in your organization is hit by the WannaCry ransomware, the worm looks for other vulnerable computers and infects them as well.


"The worm functionality attempts to infect unpatched Windows machines in the local network. At the same time, it also executes massive scanning on Internet IP addresses to find and infect other vulnerable computers. This activity results in large SMB traffic from the infected host" Microsoft says.


Infections from All Around the World

In just a few hours, the ransomware targeted over 45,000 computers in 74 countries, including United States, Russia, Germany, Turkey, Italy, Philippines and Vietnam, and that the number was still growing, according to<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Labs.

According to a report, the ransomware attack has shut down work at 16 hospitals across the UK after doctors got blocked from accessing patient files. Another report says, 85% of computers at the Spanish telecom firm, Telefonica, has get infected with this malware.

Another independent security researcher, MalwareTech, reported that a large number of U.S. organizations (at least 1,600) have been hit by WannaCry, compared to 11,200 in Russia and 6,500 in China.


Screenshots of the WannaCry ransomware with different languages, including English, Spanish, Italian, were also shared online by various users and experts on Twitter.

Bitcoin wallets seemingly associated with WannaCry were reportedly started filling up with cash.

The Spanish computer emergency response organization (CCN-CERT) has even issued an alert that warns users of the "massive attack of ransomware" from WannaCry, saying (translated version):

"The ransomware, a version of WannaCry, infects the machine by encrypting all its files and, using a remote command execution vulnerability through SMB, is distributed to other Windows machines on the same network."
"Power firm Iberdrola and utility provider Gas Natural were also reported to have suffered from the outbreak.," according to BBC.


How to Protect Yourself from WannaCry

First of all, if you haven't patched your Windows machines and servers against EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010), do it right now.

To safeguard against such ransomware infection, you should always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent an email and should never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source.

To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC.

Moreover, make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your system, and most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

Also Read: Microsoft Started Blocking Windows 7/8.1 Updates For PCs Running New Processors

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:


Avast (CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)
Avira (CVE-2017-6417)
Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)
Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)
Comodo
ESET
F-Secure<span class="highlight-match">
Kaspersky
</span>Malwarebytes
McAfee
Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

	      Hackers Are Using Android Malware To Spy On Israeli Military Personnel [1.07 Points on average]

A group of highly sophisticated state-sponsored hackers is spying on the Israeli military by hacking into the personal Android phones of individual soldiers to monitor their activities and steal data.

A newly released research by Lookout and<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>suggests that more than 100 Israeli servicemen from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) are believed to have been targeted with spyware.

Dubbed ViperRAT, the malware has specifically been designed to hijack Israeli soldiers‚Äô Android-based smartphones and remotely exfiltrate data of high value, including photos and audio recordings, directly from the compromised devices.


Modus Operandi¬†Identified

According to the security firms, IDF personnel had been compromised by social engineering techniques ‚Äî where the soldiers were lured via Facebook Messenger and other social networks into entering communications with hackers who posed as attractive women from various countries like Canada, Germany, and Switzerland.

The soldiers were then tricked into installing a trojanized version of two different, typically legitimate Android chat apps, SR Chat and YeeCall Pro, for easier communication.

The malware has also been distributed using a dropper hidden in other Android smartphone applications including a billiards game, an Israeli Love Songs player, and a Move To iOS app, which are common to Israeli citizens and available in the Google Play store.


The app then scanned soldiers' smartphones and downloaded another malicious application that masqueraded as an update for one of the already installed apps, such as WhatsApp, and tricked victims to allow various permissions in order to carry out surveillance.

This, in turn, allowed the attackers to execute on demand commands, enabling them to control phone's microphone and camera, eavesdrop on soldiers' conversations, and peer into live camera footage.

Besides this, the ViperRAT malware gathers a broad range of data from compromised devices including geolocation, call log, personal photos, SMS messages, cell phone tower information, network and device metadata, internet browsing, and app download history.

According to researchers, the hackers were able to successfully establish a widespread cyber espionage campaign by compromising dozens of mobile devices from Samsung, HTC, LG and Huawei belonging to over 100 Israeli soldiers.

Besides, almost 9,000 files stolen from compromised devices (roughly 97 percent) that were exfiltrated from compromised devices were identified by Lookout researchers as being highly encrypted images, which were taken using the device camera.

However, it's likely the IDF is not the only target.

The ViperRAT attack campaign started in July and continued to date, according to Kaspersky researchers.


Is Hamas Behind the Cyber-Spying Operation?

The IDF closely worked with Kaspersky Labs and Lookout to investigate this incident and theorized that Hamas was behind these attacks. However, Lookout researchers have come to doubt that theory.

According to Lookout researchers, "Based on tradecraft, the modular structure of code and use of cryptographic protocols [AES and RSA encryption] the actor appears to be quite sophisticated."

Researchers say Hamas is not known for sophisticated mobile capabilities, which makes it unlikely they are directly responsible for ViperRAT.

The IDF is currently working together with both Lookout and Kaspersky to identify infected targets and protect against further attacks, but there is one simple way to protect against ViperRAT: don't download apps from untrusted third-party sources.

It is no secret that cybercriminals are becoming dramatically more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day.

While new forms of cybercrime are on the rise, traditional activities seem to be shifting towards more clandestine techniques that involve the exploitation of standard system tools and protocols, which are not always monitored.

The latest example of such attack is DNSMessenger ‚Äì a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that uses DNS queries to conduct malicious PowerShell commands on compromised computers ‚Äì a technique that makes the RAT difficult to detect onto targeted systems.

The Trojan came to the attention of Cisco's Talos threat research group by a security researcher named Simpo, who highlighted a tweet that encoded text in a PowerShell script that said 'SourceFireSux.' SourceFire is one of Cisco's corporate security products.


DNSMessenger Attack Is Completely Fileless

Further analysis of the malware ultimately led Talos researchers to discover a sophisticated attack comprising a malicious Word document and a PowerShell backdoor communicating with its command-and-control servers via DNS requests.

Distributed through an email phishing campaign, the DNSMessenger attack is completely Fileless, as it does not involve writing files to the targeted system; instead, it uses DNS TXT messaging capabilities to fetch malicious PowerShell commands stored remotely as DNS TXT records.

This feature makes it invisible to standard anti-malware defenses.

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language built into Windows that allows for the automation of system administration tasks.


The malicious Word document has been crafted "to appear as if it were associated with a secure e-mail service that is secured by McAfee," according to a blog post published by Talos researchers Edmund Brumaghin and Colin Grady on Thursday.


Here's How the DNSMessenger attack Works:

When opened, the document launches a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro to execute a self-contained PowerShell script in an attempt to run the backdoor onto the target system.

What's interesting? Everything, until this point, is done in memory, without writing any malicious files to the system's disk.

Next, the VBA script unpacks a compressed and sophisticated second stage of PowerShell, which involves checking for several parameters of the target environment, like the privileges of the logged-in user and the version of PowerShell installed on the target system.

This information is then used to ensure persistence on the infected host by changing the Windows Registry and installing a third stage PowerShell script that contains a simple backdoor.

The backdoor is being added to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) database, if the victim does have administrative access, allowing the malware backdoor to stay persistent on the system even after a reboot.

The backdoor is an additional script that establishes a sophisticated 2-way communications channel over the Domain Name System (DNS) ‚Äì usually used to look up the IP addresses associated with domain names, but has support for different types of records.

The DNSMessenger malware backdoor uses DNS TXT records that, by definition, allows a DNS server to attach unformatted text to a response.

The backdoor periodically sends DNS queries to one of a series of domains hard-coded in its source code. As part of those requests, it retrieves the domain's DNS TXT record, which contains further PowerShell commands that are executed but never written to the local system.

Now, this "fourth stage" Powershell script is the actual remote control tool used by the malware attacker.

This script queries the command-and-control servers via DNS TXT message requests to ask what commands to execute. Any command received is then executed, and the output is communicated back to the C&C server, allowing the attacker to execute any Windows or application commands on the infected system.

All attackers need to do is leave malicious commands and instructions inside the TXT records of their domains, which, when queried, is executed via the Windows Command Line Processor, and the output is sent back as another DNS query.

The domains registered by the DNSMessenger RAT are all down, so till now, it is not known that what types of commands the attackers relayed to infected systems. However, the researchers say this particular RAT was used in a small number of targeted attacks.

"This malware sample is an excellent example of the length attackers are willing to go to stay undetected while operating within the environments that they are targeting," the Talos researchers said.

"It also illustrates the importance that in addition to inspecting and filtering network protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/POP3, etc. DNS traffic within corporate networks should also be considered a channel that an attacker can use to implement a fully functional, bidirectional C2 infrastructure."
This is not the first time when the researchers came across a Fileless malware. At early last month,<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>researchers also discovered fileless malware, that resides solely in the memory of the compromised computers, targeting banks, telecommunication companies, and government organizations in 40 countries.

It's now official, Instagram has suffered a massive data breach, and reportedly an unknown hacker has stolen personal details of more than 6 million Instagram accounts.

Just yesterday, we reported that Instagram had patched a critical API vulnerability that allowed the attacker to access phone numbers and email addresses for high-profile verified accounts.

However, Instagram hack now appears to be more serious than initially reported. 

Not just a few thousands of high-profile users‚Äîit's more than 6 million Instagram users, including politicians, sports stars, and media companies, who have had their Instagram profile information, including email addresses and phone numbers, available for sale on a website, called Doxagram.

The suspected Instagram hacker has launched Doxagram, an Instagram lookup service, where anyone can search for stolen information only for $10 per account.

A security researcher from<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Labs, who also found the same vulnerability and reported it to Instagram, told The Hacker News that the issue actually resided in the Instagram's mobile API, specifically in the password reset option, which apparently exposed mobile numbers and email addresses of the users in¬†the¬†JSON response‚Äîbut not passwords.


Instagram has not confirmed the hacker's claims yet, but the company said Friday it is investigating the data breach.

The news comes three days after an unknown hacker hijacked most-followed-account on Instagram belonged to Selena Gomez‚Äîwith over 125 Million followers‚Äîand posted her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber's full-frontal nude photographs.

However, Instagram did not confirm if the recent data breach was related to Selena's hacked account.

The company had already notified all of its verified users of the issue via emails and also encouraged them to be cautious if they receive any suspicious or unrecognised phone call, text message, or email.

With email addresses and phone numbers in hand, the hacker's next step could be used the stolen info in tandem with social engineering techniques to gain access to verified Instagram accounts and post on their behalves in order to embarrass them.

Instagram users are also highly recommended to enable two-factor authentication on their accounts and always secure them with a robust and different password.

Additionally, avoid clicking on suspicious links and attachments you receive in an email and providing your personal or financial details without verifying the source properly.

Over the past few years, Internet users globally have grown increasingly aware of online privacy and security issues due to mass monitoring and surveillance by government agencies, making them adopt encryption software and services.

But it turns out that hackers are taking advantage of this opportunity by creating and distributing fake versions of encryption tools in order to infect as many victims as possible.
<span class="highlight-match">
Kaspersky </span>Lab has revealed an advanced persistent threat (APT) group, nicknamed StrongPity, which has put a lot of efforts in targeting users of software designed for encrypting data and communications.

The StrongPity APT group has been using watering-hole attacks, infected installers, and malware for many years to target users of encryption software by compromising legitimate sites or setting up their own malicious copycat sites.

Watering hole attacks are designed to lure specific groups of users to their interest-based sites that typically house malicious files or redirect them to attacker-controlled downloads.

The StrongPity APT group has managed to infect users in Europe, Northern Africa, and the Middle East and targeted two free encryption utilities in different attacks: WinRAR and TrueCrypt.

WinRAR and TrueCrypt are long popular within security and privacy conscious users. WinRAR is best known for its archiving capabilities that encrypting files with AES-256 crypto, while TrueCrypt is a full-disk encryption utility that locks all files on a hard drive.

By setting up fake distribution sites that closely mimic legitimate download sites, StrongPity is able to trick users into downloading malicious versions of these encryption apps in hopes that users encrypt their data using a trojanized version of WinRAR or TrueCrypt apps, allowing attackers to spy on encrypted data before encryption occurred.


"The problem with people depending on tools like this isn‚Äôt the strength of the crypto, but more about how it's distributed," says Kurt Baumgartner, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. "This is that problem that StrongPity is taking advantage of."


Booby-Trapped WinRAR and TrueCrypt Downloads

The APT group previously set up TrueCrypt-themed watering holes in late 2015, but their malicious activity surged in end of summer 2016.

Between July and September, dozens of visitors have redirected from tamindir[.]com to true-crypt[.]com with unsurprisingly almost all of the focus on computer systems in Turkey, with some victims in the Netherlands.

However, in WinRAR case, instead of redirecting victims to a website controlled by StrongPity, the group hijacked the legitimate winrar.it website to host a malicious version of the file themselves.

The winrar.it website infected users mostly in Italy, with some victims in countries like Belgium, Algeria, Tunisia, France, Morocco and Cote D'Ivoire, while the attackers controlled site, winrar.be, infected users in Belgium, Algeria, Morocco, the Netherlands, and Canada.


Top Countries infected with StrongPity APT malware

According to Kaspersky, more than 1,000 systems infected with StrongPity malware this year. The top five countries affected by the group are Italy, Turkey, Belgium, Algeria and France.

The StrongPity APT's dropper malware was signed with "unusual digital certificates," but the group didn't re-use its fake digital certificates. It downloaded components include a backdoor, keyloggers, data stealers and other crypto-related software programs, including the putty SSH client, the filezilla FTP client, the Winscp secure file transfer program and remote desktop clients.

The dropper malware not only provides the hackers control of the system, but also allows them to steal disk contents and download other malware that would steal communication and contact information.

Therefore, users visiting sites and downloading encryption-enabled software are advised to verify both the validity of the distribution website as well as the integrity of the downloaded file itself.

Download sites that not use PGP or any strong digital code signing certificate are required to re-examine the necessity of doing so for the benefits of them as well as their own customers, explained Baumgartner.

The cold cyber war has just turned hot.

According to a story published¬†today by the New York Times, Israeli government hackers hacked into Kaspersky‚Äôs network in 2015 and caught Russian government hackers red-handed hacking US government hackers with the help of<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky.</span>

In other words ‚Äî Russia spying on America, Israel spying on Russia and America spying on everyone.

What the F^#% is going around?

It is like one is blaming another for doing exactly the same thing it is doing against someone else. Wow!

Well, the fact that everyone is spying on everyone is neither new nor any secret. However, somehow now Kaspersky Labs is at the centre of this international espionage tale for its alleged devil role.

Just last week, the Wall Street Journal, an American media agency, published a story against the Kaspersky, a Russian antivirus provider, claiming that the Russian government hackers stole highly classified NSA documents and hacking tools in 2015 from a staffer's home PC with the help of Kaspersky Antivirus.

Even if the incident is real, quoting multiple anonymous sources from US intelligence community, Wall Street Journal article failed to provide any substantial evidence to prove if Kaspersky was intentionally involved with the Russian spies or some hackers simply exploited any zero-day vulnerability in the Antivirus product.

Now, the latest NYT story, again quoting an anonymous source from Israeli Intelligence Agency, seems another attempt to justify the claims made by WSJ article about Russians hacking NSA secrets.


"The role of Israeli intelligence in uncovering [the Kaspersky Labs] breach and the Russian hackers‚Äô use of Kaspersky software in the broader search for American secrets have not previously been disclosed," the NYT reported.

According to the report, United States officials began an immediate investigation in 2015 after Israel officials notified the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) about the possible breach.

Indeed, in mid-2015, Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab detected sophisticated cyber-espionage backdoor within its corporate network and released a detailed report about the intrusion, although the company did not blame Israel for the attack.

At the time, Kaspersky said that some of the attack code the company detected shared digital fingerprints first found in the infamous Stuxnet worm, same malware which was developed by America and Israel to sabotage Iran's nuclear program in 2010.

This suspicion of malicious Kaspersky‚Äôs behaviour eventually leads the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to ban and remove Kaspersky antivirus software from all of its government computers.

Moreover, just last month, the U.S. National Intelligence Council shared a classified report with NATO allies concluding that the Russian FSB intelligence agency had access to Kaspersky's databases and as well as the source code.

However, Kaspersky Lab has always denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, any cyber espionage operations.


"Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts," Kaspersky's founder Eugene Kaspersky said in a statement.

Eugene today also announced that he has just launched an internal investigation to cross-check if United States LEA has relevant facts.

Eugene previously admitted there's a possibility that NSA hacking tools could have been picked up as malware by their Anti-malware scanner because antivirus products are designed to work in that way.


"We absolutely and aggressively detect and clean malware infections no matter the source," the antivirus company said.

Until now it is quite tough to judge if Kaspersky was involved in any wrongdoing, but the ball is in America's court, who has to provide the actual evidence to the world about the highly classified Israeli counter-intelligence operation.

Last week, we reported about a so-called 'vigilante hacker' who hacked into at least 10,000 vulnerable 'Internet of Things' devices, such as home routers and Internet-connected cameras, using a botnet malware in order to supposedly secure them.

Now, that vigilante hacker has already trapped roughly 300,000 devices in an IoT botnet known as Hajime, according to a new report published Tuesday by<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, and this number will rise with each day that passes by.

The IoT botnet malware was emerged in October 2016, around the same time when the infamous Mirai botnet threatened the Internet last year with record-setting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the popular DNS provider Dyn.


How the Hajime IoT Botnet Works

Hajime botnet works much like Mirai by spreading itself via unsecured IoT devices that have open Telnet ports and uses default passwords and also uses the same list of username and password combinations that Mirai is programmed to use.

However, the interesting part of Hajime botnet is that, unlike Mirai, once Hajime infects an IoT devices, it secures the devices by blocking access to four ports (23, 7547, 5555, and 5358) known to be the most widely used vectors for infecting IoT devices, making Mirai or other threats out of their bay.

Hajime also uses a decentralized peer-to-peer network (instead of command-and-control server) to issue updates to infected devices, making it more difficult for ISPs and Internet providers to take down the botnet.

One of the most interesting things about Hajime is the botnet also displays a cryptographically signed message every 10 minutes or so on infected device terminals, describing its creators as "just a white hat, securing some systems."

Unlike Mirai and other IoT botnets, Hajime lacks DDoS capabilities and other hacking skills except for the propagation code that lets one infected IoT device search for other vulnerable devices and infects them.


But What if‚Ä¶?

What's not known is: What the Hajime Botnet is for? or Who is behind it?

"The most intriguing thing about Hajime is its purpose," says Kaspersky security researchers. "While the botnet is getting bigger and bigger, partly due to new exploitation modules, its purpose remains unknown. We haven‚Äôt seen it being used in any type of attack or malicious activity, adding that "its real purpose remains unknown."
Also, the researchers believe that this might not happen, because Hajime botnet takes steps to hide its running processes and files on the file system, making the detection of infected systems more difficult.

So far, the purpose behind building this botnet is not entirely clear, but all signs yet point to a possible white-hat hacker, who is on his/her mission to secure open and vulnerable systems over the Internet.


However, the most concerning issue of all ‚Äî Is there any guarantee that the Hajime author will not add attack capabilities to the worm to use the hijacked devices for malicious purposes?

Maybe today the Hajime author is in the mission to secure the world, but tomorrow, when he would realize he could make money online by renting his/her botnet to others, he could be another Adam Mudd.

Mudd, a 19-year-old teenager, has recently been sentenced to 2 years in prison for creating and running a DDoS-for-hire service called 'Titanium Stresser' that made more than 1.7 million victims of DDoS attacks since 2013.


Secondly, What if the well-intentioned botnet is hijacked by some malicious actor?

If this happens, the vigilant IoT botnet could be used for malicious purposes, such as conducting DDoS attacks against online sites and services, spreading malware, or instantly bricking the infected devices at one click.

Radware researchers also believe that the flexible and extensible nature of the Hajime botnet can be used for malicious purposes, like those mentioned above and conducting real-time mass surveillance from Internet-connected webcams, according to a new threat¬†advisory published Wednesday by Radware.


Last but not the least: Do we seriously need some vigilante hackers to protect our devices and network?

This solution could be temporary, trust me. For example, the latest Hajime botnet is nothing but a band-aid.

Since Hajime has no persistence mechanism, as soon as the infected device is rebooted, it goes back to its previously unsecured state, with default passwords and the Telnet port open to the world.


How to Protect your IoT devices?

The only true solution is You ‚Äî Instead of just sitting over there, doing nothing and waiting for some vigilante hackers to do miracles, you can protect your IoT devices in a way Hajime or any well-intentioned botnet can't do.

So go and update the firmware of your devices, change their default passwords, put them behind a firewall, and if any device is by default vulnerable and cannot be updated, throw it and buy a new one.

Just keep in mind: Once a single IoT of yours gets compromised, your whole network falls under risk of getting compromised and so all your devices which are connected to that network.

Rejoice Petya-infected victims!

The master key for the original version of the Petya ransomware has been released by its creator, allowing Petya-infected victims to recover their encrypted files without paying any ransom money.

But wait, Petya is not NotPetya.

Do not confuse Petya ransomware with the latest destructive NotPetya ransomware (also known as ExPetr and Eternal Petya) attacks that wreaked havoc across the world last month, massively targeting multiple entities in Ukraine and parts of Europe.

The Petya ransomware has three variants that have infected many systems around the world, but now the author of the original malware, goes by the pseudonym Janus, made the master key available on Wednesday.

According to the security researchers, victims infected with previous variants of Petya ransomware, including Red Petya (first version) and Green Petya (second version) and early versions the GoldenEye ransomware can get their encrypted files back using the master key.

The authenticity of the master key has been verified by an independent Polish information security researcher known as Hasherezade.

"Similarly to the authors of TeslaCrypt, he released his private key, allowing all the victims of the previous Petya attacks, to get their files back," Hasherezade posted her finding on MalwareBytes on Thursday.¬†

"Thanks to the currently published master key, all the people who have preserved the images of the disks encrypted by the relevant versions of Petya, may get a chance of getting their data back."
Although the first and second version of Petya was cracked last year, the private key released by Janus offers the fastest and most reliable way yet for Petya-infected victims to decrypt their files, especially locked with the uncrackable third version.

Meanwhile,<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab research analyst Anton Ivanov also analyzed the Janus' master key and confirmed that the key unlocks all versions of Petya ransomware, including GoldenEye.

Janus created the GoldenEye ransomware in 2016 and sold the variants as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) to other hackers, allowing anyone to launch ransomware attacks with just one click and encrypt systems and demand a ransom to unlock it.

If the victim pays, Janus gets a cut of the payment. But in December, he went silent.

However, according to the Petya author, his malware has been modified by another threat actor to create NotPetya that targeted computers of critical infrastructure and corporations in Ukraine as well as 64 other countries.

The NotPetya ransomware also makes use of the NSA's leaked Windows hacking exploit EternalBlue and EternalRomance to rapidly spread within a network, and WMIC and PSEXEC tools to remotely execute malware on the machines.

Security experts even believe the real intention behind the recent ransomware outcry, which was believed to be bigger than the WannaCry ransomware,¬†was to cause disruption, rather than just another ransomware attack.

According to researchers, NotPetya is in reality wiper malware that wipes systems outright, destroying all records from the targeted systems, and asking for ransom was just to divert world's attention from a state-sponsored attack to a malware outbreak.

Lucky are not those infected with NotPetya, but the master key can help people who were attacked by previous variants of Petya and Goldeneye ransomware in the past.

Security researchers are using the key to build free decryptors for victims who still have crypto-locked hard drives.

A vulnerability in Chrome for Android is actively being exploited in the wild that allows hackers to quietly download banking trojan apps (.apk) onto victim's‚Äô device without their confirmation.

You might have encountered a pop-up advertisement that appears out of nowhere and surprise you that your mobile device has been infected with a dangerous virus and instructs you to install a security app to remove it immediately.

This malicious advertising web page automatically downloads an Android app installation (.apk) file to your device without requiring any approval.

Citing malware threats on your mobile device, attackers trick you to change your device's settings to allow installation of the third-party apps from stores other than Google Play Store and install the banking trojan app on your device.
<span class="highlight-match">
Kaspersky </span>researchers Mikhail Kuzin and Nikita Buchka discovered one such widespread malicious advertising campaign across Russian news sites and popular websites.

Since this August, the Trojan has infected over 318,000 Android devices across the world ‚Äî thanks to Google AdSense advertisements that was being abused to spread malicious mobile banking trojan, dubbed Svpeng.

"When an APK file is broken down into pieces and handed over to the save function via Blob() class, there is no check for the type of the content being saved, so the browser saves the APK file without notifying the user," the duo explains in a blog post.
Google has acknowledged the issue, blocked the malicious ads and planned to patch it, although it is unclear when the next Android Chrome version will be released.

However, if Google sticks to its six-week release cycle, users can expect an update on 3rd December 2016. So, malicious actors have over three weeks to exploit the flaw.

"[The] next time they (criminals) push their adverts on AdSense they may well choose to attack users in other countries; we have seen similar cases in the past; After all, what could be more convenient than exploiting the most popular advertising platform to download their malicious creations to hundreds of thousands of mobile devices?" the pair say.
Even if the Google patch this issue with its next software update, attackers still have an evergreen technique to trick users into downloading malicious apps by exploiting vulnerabilities in popular websites.

For example, a recently disclosed XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) flaw, discovered by Indian security researcher Jitendra Jaiswal, on WhatsApp's official websites could allow attackers to trick users into downloading malware applications.

So, it is always a good idea to install apps from official Google Play Store as well as not to change default Android settings that prevent the installation of third-party apps.

So, the best recommendation for users is to think twice before installing any app (no matter how legitimate it looks) from untrusted sources or clicking on suspicious-looking links.

Russian cyber security and antivirus vendor<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab has made available the much awaited KasperskyOS, a secure-by-design operating system based on Microkernel architecture which is specially designed for network devices, industrial control systems and the Internet of Things.

The operating system is not made for your average home PC; instead, it is meant to protect industrial systems and embedded devices from cyber attacks by preventing any third-party or malicious code from executing.

Kaspersky Lab CEO Eugene Kaspersky confirmed the rumors of a new operating system on his official blog published on Monday, saying this project under the codename 11-11 has been in the works for 14 years and has been designed from scratch.

The reason behind developing KasperskyOS is simple: Growing Internet-of-Things and embedded devices in industrial control systems (ICS) to power critical infrastructure.

It's quite easy for most companies to get rid of the virus-infected computer, as they all need to do is unplug the infected ones from the network, according to Kaspersky.

But since industrial control systems (ICS) are usually managing critical operations or infrastructure that must be powered on all the time and can not be taken offline for even a while, the malware targeting these ICS systems is a challenging problem.

So, according to Kaspersky, the solution lies in a secure operating system with strict cyber security requirements that could help reduce the chances of undocumented functionality and thus mitigates the risk of cyber attacks targeting ICS or IoT devices.


It‚Äôs Secure, But KasperskyOS is not Linux!

Yes, this OS is not just another Linux flavor.

One of the major distinctive features of Kaspersky OS is that the GUI-less operating system has been constructed from scratch and does not contain even a single string of Linux code in it.

"All the popular operating systems are not designed with security in mind, so it is simpler and safer to start from the ground up and do everything correctly. Which is just what we did," said Kaspersky.

The new OS has been designed to allow programs to execute only documented operations under its strict security policy. Only what is defined by the policy can be executed, including the functionality of the OS itself.

The customers can also examine the source code of KasperskyOS to make sure the operating system has no undocumented capabilities. The OS also has independent security engine that lets users enforce the policy that suits their security objectives.

KasperskyOS is not a general-purpose operating system; instead, it is designed for embedded devices, including IoT, telecommunication equipment, connected cars, and industrial control systems.

To create a package that could be applied in several different areas of granular customization, Kaspersky has developed three products: 


An Operating System (KasperskyOS)
A standalone secure hypervisor (KSH) for running virtual machines
A system for secure interaction between OS components (KSS)


KasperskyOS was designed to not only solves security issues but also addresses organizational and business challenges related to secure application development for embedded systems.

More detailed technical specifications of the OS can be found on the official KasperskyOS page and the KasperskyOS whitepaper.

While some payment card companies like Mastercard have switched to selfies as an alternative to passwords when verifying IDs for online payments, hackers have already started taking advantage of this new security verification methods.

Researchers have discovered a new Android banking Trojan that masquerades primarily as a video plugin, like Adobe Flash Player, pornographic app, or video codec, and asks victims to send a selfie holding their ID card, according to a blog post published by McAfee.

The Trojan is the most recent version of Acecard that has been labeled as one of the most dangerous Android banking Trojans known today, according to<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab Anti-malware Research Team.

Once successfully installed, the trojan asks users for a number of device's permissions to execute the malicious code and then waits for victims to open apps, specifically those where it would make sense to request payment card information. 


Acecard Steals your Payment Card and Real ID details


The banking trojan then overlays itself on top of the legitimate app where it proceeds to ask users for their payment card number and card details such as card holder's name, expiration date, and CVV number.

"It displays its own window over the legitimate app, asking for your credit card details," explains McAfee researcher Bruce Snell. "After validating the card number, it goes on to ask for additional information such as the 4-digit number on the back."
Once this is done, the trojan then looks to obtain users' personal information, including their name, date of birth, mailing address, for "verification purposes," and even requests a photo of the front and back sides of their ID card.

After this, the Trojan also prompts to ask users to hold their ID card in their hand, underneath their face, and take a selfie. 


Hackers can make illegal Transfers and Take Over your Online Accounts

All these pieces of information are more than enough for an attacker to verify illegal banking transactions and steal access to victims' social media accounts by confirming the stolen identities.

So far this version of Acecard Android banking Trojan has impacted users in Singapore and Hong Kong.

This social engineering trick of Trojan obviously is not new, and any tech-savvy users would quickly catch this malicious behavior as there is no reason for Google to ask for your ID card. But the trick still works with non and less technical users.

Since all of these fake apps have been distributed outside of Google Play Store, users are strongly advised to avoid downloading and installing apps from untrusted sources. Besides this, users should pay attention to the permissions apps are asking for.

Most importantly: No app needs a photo of you holding your ID card except perhaps a mobile banking service. So, always be cautious before doing that.

No More Ransom, so is the Ransomware Threat.

Launched less than a year ago, the No More Ransom (NMR) project has increased its capacity with new partners and new decryption tools added to its now global campaign to combat Ransomware.

Started as a joint initiative by Europol, the Dutch National Police, Intel Security and<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, No More Ransom is an anti-ransomware cross-industry initiative to help ransomware victims recover their data without having to pay ransom to cyber criminals.

The online website not just educates computer users to protect themselves from ransomware, but also provides a collection of free decryption tools.

Since December, more than 10,000 victims from all over the world have been able to decrypt their locked up devices without spending a penny, using ransomware decryption tools available free of charge on this platform.

Statistics show that most of the website visitors were from Russia, the Netherlands, the U.S., Italy, and Germany.

The platform is now available in 14 languages and hosts 40 free decryption tools, supplied by a range of member organizations, which can be used by users to decrypt their files which have been locked up by given strains of ransomware.


No More Ransom initiative has been joined by thirty new organizations, including Avast, CERT Polska and Eleven Paths (the Telefonica Cyber Security Unit), which shows that the threat is a worldwide issue that needs to be fought together.

The initiative has also welcomed new law enforcement organizations from Interpol, Australia, Belgium, Israel, South Korea, Russia, and Ukraine.

Since December 2016, 15 new ransomware decryption tools have been added to the online portal by partner organizations, offering more decryption possibilities to the victims:


AVAST: Alcatraz Decryptor, Bart Decryptor, Crypt888 Decryptor, HiddenTear Decryptor, Noobcrypt Decryptor and Cryptomix Decryptor
Bitdefender: Bart Decryptor CERT Polska: Cryptomix/Cryptoshield decryptor
CheckPoint: Merry X-Mas Decryptor and BarRax Decryptor
Eleven Paths:¬†Telefonica Cyber Security Unit: Popcorn Decryptor.
Emsisoft: Crypton Decryptor and Damage Decryptor.
Kaspersky Lab: Updates on Rakhni and Rannoh Decryptors.


Previously available in English, Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese and Russian, the No More Ransom site has now added new languages including Finnish, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Slovenian, Spanish and Ukrainian.

More languages are also expected to be made available soon to assist victims across the world better.

It is no secret that hackers and cybercriminals are becoming dramatically more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day.

While new forms of cybercrime are on the rise, traditional activities seem to be shifting towards more clandestine techniques that come with limitless attack vectors with low detection rates.

Security researchers have recently discovered a new fileless ransomware, dubbed "Sorebrect," which injects malicious code into a legitimate system process (svchost.exe) on a targeted system and then self-destruct itself in order to evade detection.

Unlike traditional ransomware, Sorebrect has been designed to target enterprise's servers and endpoint. The injected code then initiates the file encryption process on the local machine and connected network shares.

This fileless ransomware first compromises administrator credentials by brute forcing or some other means and then uses Microsoft‚Äôs Sysinternals PsExec command-line utility to encrypt files.

"PsExec can enable attackers to run remotely executed commands, instead of providing and using an entire interactive login session, or manually transferring the malware into a remote machine, like in RDPs," Trend Micro says.


Sorebrect Also Encrypts Network Shares

Sorebrect also scans the local network for other connected computers with open shares and locks files available on them as well.

"If the share has been set up such that anyone connected to it has read-and-write access to it, the share will also be encrypted," researchers say.
The nasty ransomware then deletes all event logs (using wevtutil.exe) and shadow copies (using vssadmin) on the infected machine that could provide forensic evidence such as files executed on the system and their timestamps, which makes this threat hard-to-detect.

In addition, Sorebrect uses the Tor network protocol in an attempt to anonymize its communication with its command-and-control (C&C) server, just like almost every other malware.


Sorebrect Ransomware Spreads Worldwide

The Sorebrect fileless ransomware has been designed to target systems from various industries including manufacturing, technology, and telecommunications.

According to Trend Micro, Sorebrect was initially targeting Middle Eastern countries like Kuwait and Lebanon, but from last month, this threat has started infecting people in Canada, China, Croatia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Taiwan, and the U.S.

"Given ransomware‚Äôs potential impact and profitability, it wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise if SOREBRECT turns up in other parts of the world, or even in the cybercriminal underground where it can be peddled as a service," the researchers note.
This is not the first time when researchers have come across Fileless malware. Two months ago, Talos researchers discovered a DNSMessenger attack that was completely Fileless and used DNS TXT messaging capabilities to compromise systems.

In February,<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>researchers also discovered fileless malware that resided solely in the memory of the compromised computers, which was found targeting banks, telecommunication companies, and government organizations in 40 countries.


Ways to Protect Against Ransomware Attacks

Since the ransomware does not target individuals but organizations, sysadmins and information security professionals can protect themselves by:

Restricting user write permissions: a significant factor that exposes network shares to ransomware by giving users full permissions.
Limiting privilege for PsExec: Limit PsExec and provide permission to run them only to system administrators.
Keeping your system and network up-to-date: Always keep your operating system, software, and other applications updated.
Backing up your data regularly: To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC.
Adopting a cyber security-aware workforce: Educating your employees about malware, threat vectors and security measure always plays a major role in any organization.

The Shadow Brokers who previously stole and leaked a portion of the NSA hacking tools and exploits is back with a Bang!

The hacking group is now selling another package of hacking tools, ‚ÄúEquation Group Windows Warez,‚Äù which includes Windows exploits and antivirus bypass tools, stolen from the NSA-linked hacking unit, The Equation Group.

For those unfamiliar with the topic, The Shadow Brokers is a notorious group of black-hat hackers who, in August 2016, leaked exploits, security vulnerabilities, and "powerful espionage tools" created by The Equation Group.

On Saturday, the Shadow Brokers posted a message on their ZeroNet based website, announcing the sale of the entire "Windows Warez" collection for 750 Bitcoin (around US$678,630).

The data dump contains many windows hacking tools, categorized as following:

Fuzzing tools (used to discover errors and security loopholes)
Exploit Framework
Network Implants
Remote Administration Tools (RAT)
Remote Code Execution Exploits for IIS, RDP, RPC, SMB Protocols (Some Zero-Days)
SMB BackDoor (Implant)

Interestingly, the Remote Administration Tool (RAT) "DanderSpritz" included in the list is the one previously leaked in the NSA's documents revealed by Edward Snowden.

Besides this, malware researcher Jacob Williams analyzed the archive of "screenshots and output of the find command across the dump" provided by the hacker as an evidence of legitimacy and estimated that the tools may also include a Fully Undetectable Malware (FUD) toolkit.


The FUD toolkit might have an ability to "evade/bypass personal security products," such as Avira, Avast, Dr.Web, ESET Antivirus, Comodo, McAfee Antivirus, Microsoft Essential, Panda, Symantec, Trend Micro and<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Antivirus.

The buyers can purchase the entire database of hacking tools that The Equation Group used against various countries to expand its espionage operations.

In August, the Shadow Brokers announced an auction attempting to sell the complete set of tools to the highest bidder, but the group canceled their auction in October due to little or no response on their public sale.

But since this time the group has made Windows hacking tools up for sale, the chances are that hackers and espionage groups would be interested in buying these hacking tools.

As part of its Vault 7 series of leaked documents, whistleblowing website WikiLeaks today released a new cache of 27 documents allegedly belonged to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

Named Grasshopper, the latest batch reveals a CLI-based framework developed by the CIA to build "customised malware" payloads for breaking into Microsoft's Windows operating systems and bypassing antivirus protection.

All the leaked documents are basically a user manual that the agency flagged as "secret" and that are supposed to be only accessed by the members of the agency, WikiLeaks claims.


Grasshopper: Customized Malware Builder Framework

According to the leaked documents, Grasshopper framework allows the agency members to easily create custom malware, depending upon the technical details, such as what operating system and antivirus the targets are using.

The Grasshopper framework then automatically puts together several components sufficient for attacking the target, and finally, delivers a Windows installer that the agency members can run on a target's computer and install their custom malware payloads.

"A Grasshopper executable contains one or more installers. An installer is a stack of one or more installer components," the documentation reads. "Grasshopper invokes each component of the stack in series to operate on a payload. The ultimate purpose of an installer is to persist a payload."
The whistleblowing website claimed the Grasshopper toolset was allegedly designed to go undetected even from the anti-virus products from the world's leading vendors including<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, Symantec, and Microsoft.


CIA's Grasshopper Uses 'Stolen' Russian Malware

According to WikiLeaks, the CIA created the Grasshopper framework as a modern cyber-espionage solution not only to be as easy to use as possible but also "to maintain persistence over infected Microsoft Windows computers."

"Grasshopper allows tools to be installed using a variety of persistence mechanisms and modified using a variety of extensions (like encryption)," Wikileaks said in the press release.
One of the so-called persistence mechanisms linked to Grasshopper is called Stolen Goods (Version 2), which shows how the CIA adapted known malware developed by cyber criminals across the world and modified it for its own uses.

One such malware is "Carberp," which is a malware rootkit developed by Russian hackers.

"The persistence method and parts of the installer were taken and modified to fit our needs," the leaked document noted. "A vast majority of the original Carberp code that was used has been heavily modified. Very few pieces of the original code exist unmodified."
It is not yet clear how recently the CIA has used the hacking tools mentioned in the documentation, but WikiLeaks says the tools were used between 2012 and 2015.

So far, Wikileaks has revealed the "Year Zero" batch which uncovered CIA hacking exploits for popular hardware and software, the "Dark Matter" batch which focused on exploits and hacking techniques the agency designed to target iPhones and Macs, and the third batch called "Marble."

Marble revealed the source code of a secret anti-forensic framework, basically an obfuscator or a packer used by the CIA to hide the actual source of its malware.

Russian antivirus vendor<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab is so upset with US software giant Microsoft that the security firm has filed more antitrust complaints against the company.

The antivirus firm initially filed a lawsuit late last year against Microsoft with Russian Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) over alleged abuse of Microsoft's dominant position in the desktop market to push its own antivirus software with Windows 10 and unfair competition in the market.

Microsoft ships Windows 10 with its own security software Windows Defender, which comes enabled it by default with the operating system.

While Microsoft has made some changes in Windows Defender since the initial complaint, Kaspersky Lab is not satisfied with the changes, filing more antitrust complaints against the software giant, this time with the European Commission and the German Federal Cartel Office.

Kaspersky Accuses Microsoft of Unfair Competitive PracticesThe antivirus firm told European antitrust regulators that Microsoft prevents third-party security software vendors from competing on equal footing with software products built into the ubiquitous Windows operating system.
"Microsoft uses its dominant position in the computer operating system market to fiercely promote its own‚Äîinferior‚Äîsecurity software (Windows Defender) at the expense of users' previously self-chosen security solution," says co-founder Eugene Kaspersky in a blog post.Kaspersky claims that Microsoft removes its antivirus software from the Windows operating system when users upgrade their systems to Windows 10, and enables its own Windows Defender anti-virus solution.

What's even more? Kaspersky also claims that Redmond doesn't provide enough time to fully test its latest Windows 10 upgrades in order to ensure that its existing software is compatible with the OS.

Kaspersky also says that Windows 10 generates the pop-up dialogue boxes when users try to run third-party antivirus software. One of its users told Kaspersky that when he upgraded his PC to Windows 10 and contacted Microsoft support team about the disappearance of security software, a support worker replied with this:
"Windows 10 is incompatible with third-party antivirus. It is a shame that you have spent money on a Kaspersky Lab product, but you ca not reinstall it without running the risk of the appearance of new bugs."In its statement, Kaspersky Lab said European antitrust regulators that "these actions by Microsoft lead to a lower level of protection for users, a limitation on their right to choose, and financial losses both for users and security solution manufacturers."

While Microsoft has regularly been improving its Windows Defender software to protect its users (even those who have never installed any anti-virus software on their systems), Kaspersky argues it is anti-competitive.
"We want Microsoft to stop misleading and misinforming our‚Äîand not only our‚Äîusers," concludes Kaspersky. "We want to see all security solutions being able to work on the Windows platform on a level playing field. And we want to see users being able to decide for themselves what they want and consider important to them."
Microsoft Said It's Their Duty to Protect Windows Customers
In return to this issue, Microsoft released a statement, saying the company reached out to Kaspersky Lab after the initial complaint filed in November 2016, but that no words between the two had exchanged so far.

Microsoft also believes Windows 10 complies with competition laws, expressing confidence that it can persuade competition watchdogs that the company had done nothing wrong.
"Microsoft's primary objective is to keep customers protected. We are confident that the security features of Windows 10 comply with competition laws. And we will answer any questions regulators may have."¬†"We're always interested in feedback from other companies, and we engage deeply with antimalware vendors and have taken a number of steps to address their feedback. We reached out directly to Kaspersky a number of months ago offering to meet directly at an executive level to better understand their concerns, but that meeting has not yet taken place."Although Kaspersky considers Microsoft's move to enable its own anti-virus software by default on Windows 10 unfair, having a built-in free antivirus tool in this age of data breaches and cyber attacks is very useful for users who can't buy, or don't buy, a good antivirus for their PCs.

However, it's still to be seen what EU regulators decide to do about this matter.

You might have heard about the recent ongoing drama of NSA hack that has sparked a larger debate on the Internet concerning abilities of US intelligence agencies as well as their own security.

Saturday morning the news broke that a mysterious group of hackers calling themselves "The Shadow Brokers" claimed it hacked an NSA-linked group and released some NSA hacking tools with a promise to sell more private "cyber weapons" to the highest bidder.

The group dumped a bunch of private hacking tools from "Equation Group" ‚Äì an elite cyber attack unit linked to the NSA ‚Äì on GitHub and Tumblr.

The Shadow Brokers hacking group has published the leaked data in two parts; one includes many hacking tools designed to inject malware into various servers and another encrypted file containing the "best files" that they made available for sale for 1 Million Bitcoins.

However, GitHub deleted the files from its page, not due to any government pressure, but because the hackers were demanding cash to release more data and the company's policy don't allow the auction or sale of stolen property on its source code management platform.

NSA Hack Raises a Few Important Question? The leak of advanced hacking tools allegedly stolen from the Equation Group has raised few questions in everyone's mind:

Is Equation Group an elite cyber attack unit linked to the NSA?
Are the Equation Group Hack and leaked exploits legitimate?
If Legit, Do the advanced hacking tools actually belong to Equation Group?
Who is behind the hack? Russia?

Here's all you need to know about the NSA Hack:

<span class="highlight-match">
Kaspersky </span>Confirmed: Leaked Hacking Tools Belong to NSA-tied Group

According to a technical report published Tuesday by security firm Kaspersky Lab, the leaked advanced hacking tools contains digital signatures that are identical to those in hacking software and malware previously used by the Equation Group.

"While we cannot surmise the attacker's identity or motivation nor where or how this pilfered trove came to be, we can state that several hundred tools from the leak share a strong connection with our previous findings from the Equation group," Kaspersky researchers said in a blog post.
Over 300 computer files found in the Shadow Brokers archive have a common implementation of RC5 and RC6 encryption algorithms ‚Äì which has been used extensively by the Equation Group.

Also, the implementation of encryption algorithms is identical to the RC5 and RC6 code in the Equation Group malware.

"There are more than 300 files in the Shadow Brokers' archive which implement this specific variation of RC6 in 24 other forms," the researcher wrote. "The chances of all these being fakes or engineered is highly unlikely."

"The code similarity makes us believe with a high degree of confidence that the tools from the Shadow Brokers' leak are related to the malware from the Equation group."
Here's the comparison of the older Equation RC6 code and the code from the new leak, which shows that they have identical functionally and share rare specific traits in their implementation:


Kaspersky Lab previously linked Equation Group to the NSA, describing it as "a threat actor that surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques, and that has been active for almost two decades."

The security firm also claimed Equation Group to be behind a variety of malware types, including Stuxnet and Flame, which are associated with cyber attacks launched by the United States.


Former NSA Personnel also Confirms the Authenticity of Leaked Data

Now, adding more proofs to the possibility and making the speculations stronger, some ex-NSA insiders say the leaked hacking tools are legitimate and linked to the NSA.

One former NSA employee who worked in its special hacking division, Tailored Access Operations (TAO), told the¬†Washington Post that "without a doubt, they're the keys to the kingdom."


"The stuff you are talking about would undermine the security of a lot of major government and corporate networks both here and abroad," said the former TAO employee, who asked Post to remain anonymous.

Moreover, another former TAO employee who also saw the leaked file said, "From what I saw, there was no doubt in my mind that it was legitimate."

So, after Kaspersky Labs analysis and former-TAO employees statements, it is clear that the leaked NSA hacking tools are legitimate.


Hack Or An Inside Job?

Moreover, it has also been speculated that the NSA hack could be an insider‚Äôs job, as concluded by Matt Suiche, founder of UAE-based security startup after he discussed this incident with a former NSA TAO employee.


"The repository containing the NSA TAO Toolkit is stored on a physically segregated network which does not touch the internet and has no reason to (remember it's a toolkit repository)," Suiche wrote in a blog post.

"There is no reason for those files to have ever been on a staging server in the first place unless someone did it on purpose. The file hierarchy and the unchanged file naming convention tends to say that the files were directly copied from its source."


Experts and Snowden suggest Russia is behind the NSA Hack


Most cyber security experts, as well as former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, believes Russia to be behind the NSA hack.

In past few weeks, WikiLeaks and an unknown hacker using an alias Guccifer 2.0 have published a large number of documents came from the breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and another separate hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee¬†(DCCC).

Several officials from US intelligence agencies and security companies have pointed fingers towards Russia for the recent Democratic hacks, though Russia has denied any involvement.


"The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. intelligence agencies have been studying the Democratic hacks, and several officials have signaled it was almost certainly carried out by Russian-affiliated hackers," the WSJ reports. "Russia has denied any involvement, but several cybersecurity companies have also released reports tying the breach to Russian hackers."

Now, both Snowden and Dave Aitel, a security expert who spent 6 years as an NSA security scientist, are speculating that the latest leak by the Shadow Brokers is in response to growing tensions between the United States and Russia over the Democratic groups' hacks.

In a stream of tweets yesterday, Snowden said the hack is likely of Russian origin, tweeting "No one knows, but I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack."


Here's the combined statement by Snowden:



"Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicate Russian responsibility. Here's why that is significant:

This leak is likely a warning that someone can prove US responsibility for any attacks that originated from this malware server. That could have significant foreign policy consequences. Particularly if any of those operations targeted US allies. Particularly if any of those operations targeted elections. Accordingly, this may be an effort to influence the calculus of decision-makers wondering how sharply to respond to the DNC hacks. TL;DR: This leak looks like a somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast."

Following Snowden tweets, Aitel also published a blog post, saying Russia is the most likely suspect behind the Democratic hacks as well as the latest leak of the NSA spying tools.

Apart from speculation, Wikileaks, which previously made it clear to harm Hillary Clinton's chances from becoming US President, also said it already own the "auction" files from the Shadow Brokers and will publish them in "due course," though the tweet has since been deleted.

Still, many questions remain unanswered¬†‚Äî who is the Shadow Brokers, how the group broke into Equation Group and stole their private hacking tools and malware, and is the group really willing to bid the auction files for 1 Million Bitcoins or is it just a distraction?

It seems like the NSA has been HACKED!

Update: The NSA Hack ‚Äî What, When, Where, How, Who & Why? Explained Here.

An unknown hacker or a group of hackers just claimed to have hacked into "Equation Group" -- a cyber-attack group allegedly associated with the United States intelligence organization NSA -- and dumped a bunch of its hacking tools (malware, private exploits, and hacking tools) online.

I know, it is really hard to believe, but some cybersecurity experts who have been examining the leak data, exploits and hacking tools, believe it to be legitimate.

Hacker Demands $568 Million in Bitcoin to Leak All Tools and Data

Not just this, the hackers, calling themselves "The Shadow Brokers," are also asking for 1 Million Bitcoins (around $568 Million) in an auction to release the 'best' cyber weapons and more files.

Widely believed to be part of the NSA, Equation Group was described as "a threat actor that surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques, and that has been active for almost two decades," according to a report published by security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>in 2015.

Equation Group was also linked to the previous infamous Regin and Stuxnet attacks, allegedly the United States sponsored hacks, though the link was never absolutely proven.

Two days back, The Shadow Brokers released some files, which it claimed came from the Equation Group, on Github¬†(deleted) and Tumblr.


Exploits for American & Chinese Firewalls Leaked:

The files mostly contained installation scripts, configurations for command-and-control (C&C) servers, and exploits allegedly designed to target routers and firewalls from American manufacturers including, Cisco, Juniper, and Fortinet.

According to the leaked files, Chinese company 'Topsec' was also an Equation Group target.

The leak mentioned names of some of the hacking tools that correlate with names used in the documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, like "BANANAGLEE" and "EPICBANANA."

"We follow Equation Group traffic," says the Shadow Broker. "We find Equation Group source range. We hack Equation Group. We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons. You see pictures. We give you some Equation Group files free, you see. This is good proof no? You enjoy!!! You break many things. You find many intrusions. You write many words. But not all, we are auction the best files."
It is yet not confirmed whether the leaked documents are legitimate or not, but some security experts agree that it likely is.

"I haven't tested the exploits, but they definitely look like legitimate exploits," Matt Suiche, founder of UAE-based cyber security firm Comae Technologies, told the Daily Dot.

While some are saying that the leak could be a very well-researched hoax, and the Bitcoin auction could be nothing but a distraction in an attempt to gain media attention.

"If this is a hoax, the perpetrators put a huge amount of effort in," security researcher The Grugq told Motherboard. "The proof files look pretty legit, and they are exactly the sorts of exploits you would expect a group that targets communications infrastructure to deploy and use."
However, if NSA has successfully been hacked, the hack would be a highly critical cyber security incident.

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have risen enormously in past few months and, mostly, they are coming from hacked and insecure internet-connected devices, most commonly known as Internet of Things (IoT).

Recent DDoS attack against DNS provider Dyn that brought down a large chunk of the Internet came from hacked and vulnerable IoT devices such as DVRs, security cameras, and smart home appliances.

This DDoS was the biggest cyber attack the world has ever seen.

Now, in the latest incident, at least five Russian banks have been subject to a swathe of DDoS attacks for two days, said the Russian banking regulator.

The state-owned Sberbank was one of the five targets of the attacks that began on last Tuesday afternoon and lasted over the next two days.

According to<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, the longest attack last for 12 hours and peaked at 660,000 requests per second came from a botnet of at least 24,000 hacked devices located in 30 countries.

Although the culprit appears to be using hacked and insecure IoT devices such as CCTV cameras or digital video recorders, Kaspersky Lab believes that the latest attack does not look like the work of the "Mirai IoT botnet" ‚Äî the one used to disrupt the Dyn DNS service.

Mirai is a piece of nasty malware that scans for IoT devices that have weak factory default setting (hard-coded usernames and passwords), converts them into bots, and then used them to launch DDoS attack.

In a statement, Sberbank representative said the bank managed to neutralize the cyber attack without disturbing the ongoing operation of its website, adding that the latest DDoS attacks were among the largest the bank had ever seen, RT reports.

Another Russian bank, Alfabank, has also confirmed the DDoS attack, though it called the attack weak. The bank's representative told RIA Novosti that "there was an attack, but it was relatively weak. It did not affect Alfabank's business systems in any way."

Kaspersky said more than a half of the IoT botnet devices were situated in the United States, India, Taiwan, and Israel. To gain control over the devices, the hackers took advantage of smart devices that use easy to guess passwords.

Security researchers are continually pointing out serious threats from new connected devices that have been rushed to market with poor, or no, security implementations.

Just last week, the DDoS attack through hacked IoT devices led to the disruption of the heating systems for at least two apartments in the city of Lappeenranta, literally leaving their residents in subzero weather.

Keeping in mind the rise in the number of insecure IoT devices, it is entirely possible that the next round of attacks emerged from IoT-based botnet could reach orders of magnitude larger so much so that it could even take down our cities if we let it.

So the best way to protect your smart devices from being a part of DDoS botnet is to be more vigilant about the security of your internet-connected devices. Change the default settings and credentials of your devices and always protect your devices behind a firewall.

Although IoT manufacturers and Internet standard creators have a huge role to play in securing these vulnerable devices, consumers must also require taking some personal responsibility for safeguarding their own devices.

Unlike specially crafted malware specifically developed to take advantage of Windows operating system platform, cyber attackers have started creating cross-platform malware for wider exploitation.

Due to the rise in popularity of Mac OS X and other Windows desktop alternatives, hackers have begun designing cross-platform malware modularly for wide distribution.

Cross-platform malware is loaded with specialized payloads and components, allowing it to run on multiple platforms.

One such malware family has recently been discovered by researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab, which run on all the key operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Stefan Ortloff, a researcher from Kaspersky Lab‚Äôs Global Research and Analysis Team, first discovered the Linux and Windows variants of this family of cross-platform backdoor, dubbed Mokes, in January this year.

Now, the researcher today confirmed the existence of an OS X variant of this malware family, explaining a technical breakdown of the backdoor in a post on Securelist.

Alike the Linux and Windows variants, the OS X backdoor variant, Backdoor.OSX.Mokes.a, specializes in capturing audio-video, obtaining keystrokes as well as taking screenshots every 30 seconds from a victim‚Äôs machine.

The variant is written in C++ using Qt, a cross-platform application framework that is widely being used for developing applications to run on various software and hardware platforms.

The backdoor also has the capability to monitor removable storage like when a USB drive is connected to or removed from the computer.

It can also scan the file system for Office documents, including .docx, .doc, .xlsx, and .xls files.

The OS X backdoor can also execute arbitrary commands on the victim‚Äôs computer from its command and control (C&C) server.

The backdoor establishes an encrypted connection with its command and control server and communicates using AES-256 encryption, which is considered to be a secure encryption algorithm.

Ortloff notes, right after execution, the OS X sample he analyzed copies itself to a handful of locations, including caches that belong to Skype, Dropbox, Google, and Firefox. This behavior is similar to the Linux variant that copied itself to locations belonging to Dropbox and Firefox after execution.

The researcher has not attributed the Mokes backdoor family to any hacking group, state-sponsored hacker or country, nor he detailed about the OS X backdoor‚Äôs infection vector and how widespread it is.

However, based on the currently available information, the backdoor seems to be a sophisticated piece of malware.

Do you know‚ÄîUnited States Government has banned federal agencies from using<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>antivirus software over spying fear?

Though there's no solid evidence yet available, an article published by WSJ claims¬†that the Russian state-sponsored hackers stole highly classified NSA documents from a contractor in 2015 with the help of a security program made by Russia-based security firm Kaspersky Lab.

Currently, there is no way to independently confirm if the claims on the popular security vendor published by the Wall Street Journal is accurate‚Äîand the story does not even prove the involvement of Kaspersky.


"As a private company, Kaspersky Lab does not have inappropriate ties to any government, including Russia, and the only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight," Kaspersky said in a statement.

The NSA contractor working with the American intelligence agency, whose identity has not yet been disclosed, reportedly downloaded a cache of highly classified information from government systems and moved it to a personal computer at home, which is clear violation of known security procedures.

Citing some anonymous sources, the Journal says that the targeted computer was running Kaspersky antivirus‚Äîthe same app the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently banned from all government computer systems over spying fear.

The classified documents taken to home by the contractor contained details about how the NSA breaks into foreign computer networks for cyber espionage operations as well as defends its systems against cyber attacks.

Although what role Kaspersky played in the breach is not entirely clear, US officials believe antivirus scan performed by Kaspersky Lab‚Äôs security software on the contractor's computer helped Russian hackers in identifying the files containing sensitive information.

In response to the WSJ story, Kaspersky CEO Eugene Kaspersky said his company "has not been provided with any evidence substantiating the company's involvement in the alleged incident. The only conclusion sees to be that Kaspersky Lab is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight."

Also, it is not clear exactly how the files were stolen, but it has been speculated that the antivirus‚Äô practice of uploading suspicious files (malware executables) on the company's server, located in Russia, may have granted the Russian government access to the data.

Another possibility is that Russian hackers stole the confidential data by exploiting vulnerabilities in Kaspersky Lab software installed on the targeted system, according to the person, who asked not to be identified.


"Now, if we assume that what is reported is true: that Russian hackers exploited a weakness in our products installed on the PC of one of our users, and the government agencies charged with protecting national security knew about that, why didn‚Äôt they report it to us?" Kaspersky said.


"We patch the most severe bugs in a matter of hours; so why not make the world a bit more secure by reporting the vulnerability to us? I cannot imagine an ethical justification for not doing so."

This breach of NSA classified files, which is being called "one of the most significant security breaches in recent years," was occurred in 2015, but detected in 2016.

However, it is not clear whether this security incident has any ties to the Shadow Brokers campaign, an ongoing public leak of NSA hacking tools that many officials and experts have linked to the Russian government.

It is another embarrassing breach for the NSA, which has long struggled with contractor security‚Äîstarting from Edward Snowden to Harold Thomas Martin and Reality Winner.

Cyber criminals are becoming more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day. They have now shifted from traditional to more clandestine techniques that come with limitless attack vectors and are harder to detect.

Security researchers have discovered that one of the most dangerous Android banking Trojan families has now been modified to add a keylogger to its recent strain, giving attackers yet another way to steal victims sensitive data.
<span class="highlight-match">
Kaspersky </span>Lab's Senior malware analyst Roman Unuchek spotted a new variant of the well-known Android banking Trojan, dubbed Svpeng, in the mid of last month with a new keylogger feature, which takes advantage of Android's Accessibility Services.

Trojan Exploits 'Accessibility Services' to Add Keylogger
Yes, the keylogger added in the new version of Svpeng takes advantage of Accessibility Services ‚Äî an Android feature that provides users alternative ways to interact with their smartphone devices.

This change makes the Svpeng Trojan able not only to steal entered text from other apps installed on the device and log all keystrokes, but also to grant itself more permissions and rights to prevent victims from uninstalling the Trojan.

In November last year, the Svpeng banking trojan infected over 318,000 Android devices across the world over the span of only two months with the help of Google AdSense advertisements that was abused to spread the malicious banking Trojan.

Over a month ago, researchers also discovered another attack taking advantage of Android's Accessibility Services, called Cloak and Dagger attack, which allows hackers to silently take full control of the infected devices and steal private data.

If You Are Russian, You Are Safe!
Although the new variant of the Svpeng malware is not yet widely deployed, the malware has already hit users in 23 countries over the course of a week, which include Russia, Germany, Turkey, Poland, and France.

But what's worth noticing is that, even though most infected users are from Russia, the new variant of Svpeng Trojan doesn't perform malicious actions on those devices.

According to Unuchek, after infecting the device, the Trojan first checks the device's language. If the language is Russian, the malware prevents further malicious tasks‚Äîthis suggests the criminal group behind this malware is Russian, who are avoiding to violate Russian laws by hacking locals.

How 'Svpeng' Trojan Steals Your Money
Unuchek says the latest version of Svpeng he spotted in July was being distributed through malicious websites that disguised as a fake Flash Player.

Once installed, as I have mentioned above, the malware first checks for the device language and, if the language is not Russian, asks the device to use Accessibility Services, which opens the infected device to a number of dangerous attacks.

With having access to Accessibility Services, the Trojan grants itself device administrator rights, displays an overlay on the top of legitimate apps, installs itself as a default SMS app, and grants itself some dynamic permissions, such as the ability to make calls, send and receive SMS, and read contacts.

Additionally, using its newly-gained administrative capabilities, the Trojan can block every attempt of victims to remove device administrator rights‚Äîthereby preventing the uninstallation of the malware.

Using accessibility services, Svpeng gains access to the inner working of other apps on the device, allowing the Trojan to steal text entered on other apps and take screenshots every time the victim presses a button on the keyboard, and other available data.
"Some apps, mainly banking ones, do not allow screenshots to be taken when they are on top. In such cases, the Trojan has another option to steal data ‚Äì it draws its phishing window over the attacked app," Unuchek says.¬†"It is interesting that, in order to find out which app is on top, it uses accessibility services too."All the stolen information is then uploaded to the attackers' command and control (C&C) server. As part of his research, Unuchek said he managed to intercept an encrypted configuration file from the malware's C&C server.

Decrypting the file helped him find out some of the websites and apps that Svpeng targets, as well as help him obtain a URL with phishing pages for both the PayPal and eBay mobile apps, along with links for banking apps from the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Australia, France, Poland, and Singapore.

Besides URLs, the file also allows the malware to receive various commands from the C&C server, which includes sending SMS, collecting information such as contacts, installed apps and call logs, opening the malicious link, gathering all SMS from the device, and stealing incoming SMS.

Lukas Stefanko, malware researcher at ESET, has shared a video (given below) with The Hacker News, demonstrating the working of this malware.


The Evolution of 'Svpeng' Android Banking Malware
Researchers at Kaspersky Lab initially discovered the Svpeng Android banking malware trojan back in 2013, with primary capability‚ÄîPhishing.

Back in 2014, the malware was then modified to add a ransomware component that locked victim's device (by FBI because they visited sites containing pornography) and demanded $500 from users.

The malware was among the first to begin attacking SMS banking, use phishing web pages to overlay other apps in an effort to steal banking credentials and to block devices and demand money.

In 2016, cyber criminals were actively distributing Svpeng via Google AdSense using a vulnerability in the Chrome web browser, and now abusing Accessibility Services, which possibly makes Svpeng the most dangerous mobile banking malware family to date that can steal¬†almost anything‚Äîfrom your Facebook credentials to your credit cards and bank accounts.

How to Protect Your Smartphone From Hackers
With just Accessibility Services, this banking Trojan gains all necessary permissions and rights to steal lots of data from the infected devices.

The malicious techniques of the Svpeng malware even work on fully-updated Android devices with the latest Android version and all security updates installed, so it is little users can do in order to protect themselves.

There are standard protection measures you need to follow to remain unaffected:

Always stick to trusted sources, like Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, but only from trusted and verified developers.
Most importantly, verify app permissions before installing apps. If any app is asking more than what it is meant for, just do not install it.
Do not download apps from third party sources, as most often such malware spreads via untrusted third-parties.
Avoid unknown and unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots and Keep your Wi-Fi turned OFF when not in use.
Never click on links provided in an SMS, MMS or email. Even if the email looks legit, go directly to the website of origin and verify any possible updates.
Install a good antivirus app that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device, and always keep the app up-to-date.

A new Android-rooting malware with an ability to disable device‚Äô security settings in an effort to perform malicious tasks in the background has been detected on the official Play Store.

What's interesting? The app was smart enough to fool Google security mechanism by first pretending itself to be a clean app and then temporarily replacing it with a malicious version.

Security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab discovered a new piece of Android rooting malware that was being distributed as gaming apps on the Google Play Store, hiding behind puzzle game "colourblock," which was being downloaded at least 50,000 times prior to its removal.

Dubbed Dvmap, the Android rooting malware disables device's security settings to install another malicious app from a third-party source and also injects malicious code into the device system runtime libraries to gain root access and stay persistent.

"To bypass Google Play Store security checks, the malware creators used a very interesting method: they uploaded a clean app to the store at the end of March, 2017, and would then update it with a malicious version for short period of time," the researchers said.¬†

"Usually they would upload a clean version back on Google Play the very same day. They did this at least 5 times between 18 April and 15 May."


Here's How Dvmap Malware Works


Dvmap Trojan works on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Android, which once installed, attempts to gain root access on the device and tries to install several modules on the system including a few written in Chinese, along with a malicious app called "com.qualcmm.timeservices."

To make sure the malicious module gets executed with system rights, the malware overwrites system's runtime libraries depending on which Android version the device is running.

To complete the installation of the above-mentioned malicious app, the Trojan with system rights turns off "Verify Apps," feature and modify system setting to allow app installation from 3rd party app stores.

"Furthermore, it can grant the "com.qualcmm.timeservices" app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights," the researchers said.
This malicious 3rd party app is responsible for connecting the infected device to the attacker's command-and-control server, giving out full control of the device into the hands of attackers.

However, the researchers said, they haven't noticed any commands received by the infected Android devices so far, so it's unclear "what kind of files will be executed, but they could be malicious or advertising files."

 

How to Protect Yourself Against Dvmap Malware

Researchers are still testing the Dvmap malware, but meanwhile, advise users who installed the puzzle game in question to back up their device's data and perform a full factory data reset in an effort to mitigate the malware.

To prevent yourself from being targeted by such apps, always beware of fishy apps, even when downloading from Google Play Store, and try to stick to the trusted brands only. Moreover, always look at the comments left by other users.

Always verify app permissions before installing any app and grant only those permissions which have relevant context for the app's purpose.

Last but not the least, always keep a good antivirus app on your device that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device and keep it up-to-date.

	      WannaCry Coding Mistakes Can Help Files Recovery Even After Infection [1.11 Points on average]

Last month¬†WannaCry ransomware¬†hit more than 300,000 PCs across the world within just 72 hours by using its self-spreading capabilities to infect vulnerable Windows PCs, particularly those using vulnerable versions of the OS, within the same network.

But that doesn't mean WannaCry was a high-quality piece of ransomware.

Security researchers have recently discovered some programming errors in the code of the WannaCrypt ransomware worm that might allow victims to restore their locked files without paying for any decryption key.

After deeply analysing the WannaCry code, security company at<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>Lab found that the ransomware was full of mistakes that could allow some of its victims to restore their files with publicly available free recovery tools or even with simple commands.

Anton Ivanov, senior malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, along with colleagues Fedor Sinitsyn and Orkhan Mamedov, detailed three critical errors made by WannaCry developers that could allow sysadmins to restore potentially lost files.

According to researchers, the issues reside in the way WannaCry ransomware deletes original files after encryption. In general, the malware first renames files to change their extension to ".WNCRYT," encrypt them and then delete the original files.

Recovering Read-only FilesSince it is not at all possible for malicious software to directly encrypt or modify read-only files, WannaCry copies the files and creates their encrypted copies.

While the original files remain untouched but are given a 'hidden' attribute, getting the original data back simply requires victims to restore their normal attributes.

That wasn't the only mistake within the WannaCry's code, as in some cases, the malware fails to delete the files after encrypting them properly.

Recovering Files from the System Drive (i.e. C drive)
Researchers have said that files stored on the important folders, like Desktop or Documents folder, can not be recovered without the decryption key because WannaCry has been designed to overwrite original files with random data before removal.

However, researchers noticed that other files stored outside of important folders on the system drive could be restored from the temporary folder using a data recovery software.
‚Äú...the original file will be moved to %TEMP%\%d.WNCRYT (where %d denotes a numeric value). These files contain the original data and are not overwritten,‚Äù researchers said.
Recovering Files from the Non-System DrivesResearchers also found that for non-system drives, the WannaCry Ransomware creates a hidden '$RECYCLE' folder and moves original files into this directory after encryption.¬†You can recover those files just by unhiding the '$RECYCLE' folder.

Also, due to "synchronization errors" in WannaCry's code, in many cases the original files remain in the same directory, making it possible for victims to restore insecurely deleted files using available data recovery software.

Programming Blunders: The New Hope for WannaCry Victims
These programming errors in the code of WannaCry offer hope to many victims.
"If you were infected with WannaCry ransomware there is a good possibility that you will be able to restore a lot of the files on the affected computer," Kaspersky Lab wrote in a blog post published Thursday. "The code quality is very low.""To restore files, you can use the free utilities available for data recovery."The recovery of files infected by WannaCry was first made possible by French researchers Adrien Guinet and Benjamin Delpy, who made a free WannaCry decryption tool that works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Server 2008.

It's been almost a month since WannaCry epidemic hit computers worldwide, but the hackers behind the self-spread ransomware, which leverages leaked NSA's Windows SMB exploits EternalBlue and DoublePulsar, have not been identified yet.

While police and cyber security firms continue to search for answers surrounding the origins of the WannaCry campaign, Dark web intelligence firm Flashpoint recently indicated the perpetrators might be Chinese, based on its linguistic analysis.

	      Turns Out New Petya is Not a Ransomware, It‚Äôs a Destructive Wiper Malware [0.98 Points on average]

What if I say the Tuesday's devastating global malware outbreak was not due to any ransomware infection?

Yes, the Petya ransomware attacks that began infecting computers in several countries, including Russia, Ukraine, France, India and the United States on Tuesday and demands $300 ransom was not designed with the intention of restoring the computers at all.

According to a new analysis, the virus was designed to look like ransomware but was wiper malware that wipes computers outright, destroying all records from the targeted systems.

Comae Technologies Founder Matt Suiche, who closely looked the operation of the malware, said after analyzing the virus, known as Petya, his team found that it was a "Wiper malware," not ransomware.

Security experts even believe the real attack has been disguised to divert world's attention from a state-sponsored attack on Ukraine to a malware outbreak.


"We believe the ransomware was, in fact, a lure to control the media narrative, especially after the WannaCry incident, to attract the attention on some mysterious hacker group rather than a national state attacker," Suiche writes.


Is Petya Ransomware Faulty or Over-Smart?

Petya is a nasty piece of malware that, unlike other traditional ransomware, does not encrypt files on a targeted system one by one. 

Instead, Petya reboots victims computers and encrypts the hard drive's master file table (MFT) and renders the master boot record (MBR) inoperable, restricting access to the full system by seizing information about file names, sizes, and location on the physical disk.

Then Petya ransomware takes an encrypted copy of MBR and replaces it with its own malicious code that displays a ransom note, leaving computers unable to boot.


However, this new variant of Petya does not keep a copy of replaced MBR, mistakenly or purposely, leaving infected computers unbootable even if victims get the decryption keys. 

Also, after infecting one machine, the Petya ransomware scans the local network and quickly infects all other machines (even fully-patched) on the same network, using EternalBlue SMB exploit, WMIC and PSEXEC tools.


Don't Pay Ransom; You Wouldn‚Äôt Get Your Files Back

So far, nearly 45 victims have already paid total $10,500 in Bitcoins in hope to get their locked files back, but unfortunately, they would not.

It's because the email address, which was being set-up by the attackers to communicate with victims and send decryption keys, was suspended by the German provider shortly after the outbreak.

Meaning, even if victims do pay the ransom, they will never recover their files.<span class="highlight-match"> Kaspersky </span>researchers also said same.


"Our analysis indicates there is little hope for victims to recover their data. We have analyzed the high-level code of the encryption routine, and we have figured out that after disk encryption, the threat actor could not decrypt victims‚Äô disks," the security firm said.


"To decrypt a victim‚Äôs disk threat actors need the installation ID. In previous versions of 'similar' ransomware like Petya/Mischa/GoldenEye this installation ID contained the information necessary for key recovery."

If claims made by the researcher is correct that the new variant of Petya is a destructive malware designed to shut down and disrupt services around the world, the malware has successfully done its job.

However, it is still speculation, but the virus primarily and massively targeted multiple entities in Ukraine, including the country's local metro, Kiev's Boryspil airport, electricity supplier, the central bank, and the state telecom.

Other countries infected by the Petya virus included Russia, France, Spain, India, China, the United States, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Turkey and South Korea.


How Did Petya get into the Computers in the First Place?

According to research conducted by Talos Intelligence, little-known Ukrainian firm MeDoc is likely the primary source of the yesterday's global ransomware outbreak.

Researchers said the virus has possibly been spread through a malicious software update to a Ukrainian tax accounting system called MeDoc, though MeDoc has denied the allegations in a lengthy Facebook post.


"At the time of updating the program, the system could not be infected with the virus directly from the update file," translated version of MeDoc post reads. "We can argue that users of the MEDoc system can not infect their PC with viruses at the time of updating the program."

However, several security researchers and even Microsoft agreed with Talo's finding, saying MeDoc was breached and the virus was spread via updates.

Hit by Jaff Ransomware? Don't pay the Ransom. You can unlock your files for Free!
<span class="highlight-match">
Kaspersky </span>Labs has released an updated version 1.21.2.1 of its free ransomware decryption tool, RakhniDecryptor, which can now also decrypt files locked by the Jaff ransomware.

Security researchers at Kaspersky Labs have discovered a weakness in the Jaff ransomware code that makes it possible for victims to unlock their Jaff-infected files for free.

First identified last month, Jaff is relatively new ransomware that's being distributed with the help of 'Necurs botnet' that currently controls over 6 million infected computers worldwide.

Necurs botnet is the same botnet ‚Äì army of compromised internet connected devices ‚Äì that was used to distribute Dridex Banking Trojan and Locky ransomware, which also infects users‚Äô machines, encrypt files and then demand a ransom before unlocking them.

Jaff ransomware (Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Jaff) attack is primarily carried out by sending spam emails to millions of users with an attached PDF, which if clicked, opens up an embedded Word document with a malicious macro script to downloads and execute the ransomware.

Once victims download and enable a Word macro associated with the .PDF, the Jaff ransomware gets downloaded onto their computer, encrypting victims files and then demanding a ransom of between 0.5 to 2 Bitcoin (~$1,500 to $5,000 today).

The Jaff attack started on May 12 ‚Äì the same day when the devastating WannaCry ransomware debuted ‚Äì by sending spam emails at the speed of 5 Million emails per hour.


How to Use RakhniDecryptor

Kaspersky RakhniDecryptor tool is a lightweight and portable piece of software designed to decrypt files encrypted by several variants of ransomware including Lobzik, Rakhni, Mircop, Crusis and 17 others.

RakhniDecryptor is very easy to use and doesn't require any technical knowledge. Here's the list of simple steps to use this tool:

Download RakhniDecryptor 1.21.2.1
Run the RakhniDecryptor.exe file on the infected computer
Click 'Change parameters' to select the objects to scan (hard drives/removable drives/network drives)
Click the 'Start Scan' button and then choose the specify path to one of the encrypted files
The RakhniDecryptor utility will then recover the decryption password to unlock files




How to Protect Yourself From Ransomware Attacks

Whether it's Jaff, Locky, CoinVault, TeslaCrypt, or any other ransomware, the protection measures are standard.

To safeguard against ransomware infections, you should always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent in an email and never click on links inside those documents unless verifying their source.

Check if macros are disabled in your MS Office apps. If not, block macros from running in MS Office files from the Internet. In enterprises, your system administrators can set the default setting for macros.

In order to always have a tight grip on all your important documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes copies of your files to an external storage device which is not always connected to your PC.

Moreover, make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your system and keep them up-to-date, and most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

If you're an engineer and use LabVIEW software to design machines or industrial equipments, you should be very suspicious while opening any VI (virtual instrument) file.

LabVIEW, developed by American company National Instruments, is a visual programming language and powerful system-design tool that is being used worldwide in hundreds of fields and provides engineers with a simple environment to build measurement or control systems

Security researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco'</span>s Talos Security Intelligence have discovered a critical vulnerability in LabVIEW software that could allow attackers to execute malicious code on a target computer, giving them full control of the system.

Identified as CVE-2017-2779, the code execution vulnerability could be triggered by opening a specially crafted VI file, a proprietary file format used by LabVIEW.

The vulnerability originates because of memory corruption issue in the RSRC segment parsing functionality of LabVIEW.

Modulating the values within the RSRC segment of a VI file causes a controlled looping condition, which results in an arbitrary null write.

"A specially crafted LabVIEW virtual instrument file (with the *.vi extension) can cause an attacker controlled looping condition resulting in an arbitrary null write," Talos researchers explain.¬†

"An attacker controlled VI file can be used to trigger this vulnerability and can potentially result in code execution."
Talos researchers have successfully tested the vulnerability on LabVIEW 2016 version 16.0, but National Instruments has refused to consider this issue as a vulnerability in their product and had no plans to release any patch to address the flaw.

However, the issue should not be ignored, because the threat vector is almost similar to many previously disclosed Microsoft Office vulnerabilities, in which victims got compromised after opening malicious MS Word file received via an email or downloaded from the Internet.

"The consequences of a successful compromise of a system that interacts with the physical world, such as a data acquisition and control systems, may be critical to safety," the researchers write.¬†

"Organisations that deploy such systems, even as pilot projects, should be aware of the risk posed by vulnerabilities such as these and adequately protect systems."
Since there is no patch available, the LabVIEW users are left with only one option‚Äîbe very careful while opening any VI file you receive via an email.

For more technical details about the vulnerability, you can head on to Cisco Talos' advisory.

A 7-year-old critical remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered in Samba networking software that could allow a remote attacker to take control of an affected Linux and Unix machines.

Samba is open-source software (re-implementation of SMB networking protocol) that runs on the majority of operating systems available today, including Windows, Linux, UNIX, IBM System 390, and OpenVMS.

Samba allows non-Windows operating systems, like GNU/Linux or Mac OS X, to share network shared folders, files, and printers with Windows operating system.

The newly discovered remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) affects all versions newer than Samba 3.5.0 that was released on March 1, 2010.

"All versions of Samba from 3.5.0 onwards are vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability, allowing a malicious client to upload a shared library to a writable share, and then cause the server to load and execute it," Samba wrote in an advisory published Wednesday.


Linux version of EternalBlue Exploit?


According to the Shodan computer search engine, more than 485,000 Samba-enabled computers exposed port 445 on the Internet, and according to researchers at Rapid7, more than 104,000 internet-exposed endpoints appeared to be running vulnerable versions of Samba, out of which 92,000 are running unsupported versions of Samba.

Since Samba is the SMB protocol implemented on Linux and UNIX systems, so some experts are saying it is "Linux version of EternalBlue," used by the WannaCry ransomware.

...or should I say¬†SambaCry?

Keeping in mind the number of vulnerable systems and ease of exploiting this vulnerability, the Samba flaw could be exploited at large scale with wormable capabilities.

Home networks with network-attached storage (NAS) devices could also be vulnerable to this flaw.


Exploit Code Released! (Bonus: Metasploit Module)


The flaw actually resided in the way Samba handled shared libraries. A remote attacker could use this Samba arbitrary module loading vulnerability (POC code) to upload a shared library to a writable share and then cause the server to load and execute malicious code.

The vulnerability is hell easy to exploit. Just one line of code is required to execute malicious code on the affected system.

simple.create_pipe("/path/to/target.so")
However, the Samba exploit has already been ported to Metasploit, a penetration testing framework, enabling researchers as well as hackers to exploit this flaw easily.


Patch and Mitigations

The maintainers of Samba has already patched the issue in their new versions Samba versions 4.6.4/4.5.10/4.4.14, and are urging those using a vulnerable version of Samba to install the patch as soon as possible.

But if you can not upgrade to the latest versions of Samba immediately, you can work around the vulnerability by adding the following line to your Samba configuration file smb.conf:

nt pipe support = no
Once added, restart the network's SMB daemon (smbd) and you are done. This change will prevent clients from fully accessing some network machines, as well as disable some expected functions for connected Windows systems.

While Linux distribution vendors, including Red Hat and Ubuntu, have already released patched versions for its users,¬†the larger risk is that from NAS device consumers that might not be updated as quickly.

Craig Williams of<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>said that given the fact that most NAS devices run Samba and have very valuable data, the vulnerability "has potential to be the first large-scale Linux ransomware worm."

Update:¬†Samba maintainers have also provided patches for older and unsupported versions of Samba.

Meanwhile, Netgear released a security advisory for CVE-2017-7494, saying a large number of its routers and NAS product models are affected by the flaw because they use Samba version 3.5.0 or later.

However, the company currently released firmware fixes for only ReadyNAS products running OS 6.x.

A highly critical vulnerability has been discovered in the<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>Systems‚Äô WebEx browser extension for Chrome and Firefox, for the second time in this year, which could allow attackers to remotely execute malicious code on a victim's computer.

Cisco WebEx is a popular communication tool for online events, including meetings, webinars and video conferences that help users connect and collaborate with colleagues around the world. The extension has roughly 20 million active users.

Discovered by Tavis Ormandy of Google Project Zero and Cris Neckar of Divergent Security, the remote code execution flaw (CVE-2017-6753) is due to a designing defect in the WebEx browser extension.

To exploit the vulnerability, all an attacker need to do is trick victims into visiting a web page containing specially crafted malicious code through the browser with affected extension installed.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in the attacker executing arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser and gaining control of the affected system.

"I see several problems with the way sanitization works, and have produced a remote code execution exploit to demonstrate them," Ormandy¬†said. "This extension has over 20M [million] active Chrome users alone, FireFox and other browsers are likely to be affected as well."
Cisco has already patched the vulnerability and released ‚ÄúCisco WebEx Extension 1.0.12‚Äù update for Chrome and Firefox browsers that address this issue, though "there are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."


"This vulnerability affects the browser extensions for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, Cisco WebEx Centers (Meeting Center, Event Center, Training Center, and Support Center), and Cisco WebEx Meetings when they are running on Microsoft Windows," Cisco confirmed in an advisory released today.

Firefox Extension


In general, users are always recommended to run all software as a non-privileged user in an effort to diminish the effects of a successful attack.

Fortunately, Apple's Safari, Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Microsoft's Edge are not affected by this vulnerability.

Cisco WebEx Productivity Tools, Cisco WebEx browser extensions for Mac or Linux, and Cisco WebEx on Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer are not affected by the vulnerability, the company confirmed.

The remote code execution vulnerability in Cisco WebEx extension has been discovered second time in this year.

Ormandy alerted the networking giant to an RCE flaw in the WebEx browser extension earlier this year as well, which even led to Google and Mozilla temporarily removing the add-on from their stores.

The group of unknown hackers who hijacked CCleaner's download server to distribute a malicious version of the popular system optimization software targeted at least 20 major international technology companies with a second-stage payload.

Earlier this week, when the CCleaner hack was reported, researchers assured users that there's no second stage malware used in the massive attack and affected users can simply update their version in order to get rid of the malicious software.

However, during the analysis of the hackers' command-and-control (C2) server to which the malicious CCleaner versions connected, security researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco'</span>s Talos Group found evidence of a second payload (GeeSetup_x86.dll, a lightweight backdoor module) that was delivered to a specific list of computers based on local domain names.


Affected Technology Firms¬†

According to a predefined list mentioned in the configuration of the C2 server, the attack was designed to find computers inside the networks of the major technology firms and deliver the secondary payload. The target companies included:

Google
Microsoft
Cisco
Intel
Samsung
Sony
HTC
Linksys
D-Link
Akamai
VMware

In the database, researchers found a list of nearly 700,000 backdoored machines infected with the malicious version of CCleaner, i.e. the first-stage payload, and a list of at least 20 machines that were infected with the secondary payload to get a deeper foothold on those systems.

The CCleaner hackers specifically chose these 20 machines based upon their Domain name, IP address, and Hostname. The researchers believe the secondary malware was likely intended for industrial espionage.


CCleaner Malware Links to Chinese Hacking Group

According to the researchers from Kaspersky, the CCleaner malware shares some code with the hacking tools used by a sophisticated Chinese hacking group called Axiom, also known as APT17, Group 72, DeputyDog, Tailgater Team, Hidden Lynx or AuroraPanda.

"The malware injected into #CCleaner has shared code with several tools used by one of the APT groups from the #Axiom APT 'umbrella'," tweeted director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab.
Cisco researchers also note that one configuration file on the attacker's server was set for China's time zone, which suggests China could be the source of the CCleaner attack. However, this evidence alone is not enough for attribution.

Cisco Talos researchers also said that they have already notified the affected tech companies about a possible breach.


Removing Malicious CCleaner Version would Not Help

Just removing the Avast's software application from the infected machines would not be enough to get rid of the CCleaner second stage malware payload from their network, with the attackers' still-active C2 server.

So, affected companies that have had their computers infected with the malicious version of CCleaner are strongly recommended to fully restore their systems from backup versions before the installation of the tainted security program.

"These findings also support and reinforce our previous recommendation that those impacted by this supply chain attack should not simply remove the affected version of CCleaner or update to the latest version, but should restore from backups or reimage systems to ensure that they completely remove not only the backdoored version of CCleaner but also any other malware that may be resident on the system," the researchers say.
For those who are unaware, the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware, and affected users should update the software to version 5.34 or higher.

If you have downloaded or updated CCleaner application on your computer between August 15 and September 12 of this year from its official website, then pay attention‚Äîyour computer has been compromised.

CCleaner is a popular application with over 2 billion downloads, created by Piriform and recently acquired by Avast, that allows users to clean up their system to optimize and enhance performance.

Security researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>Talos discovered that the download servers used by Avast to let users download the application were compromised by some unknown hackers, who replaced the original version of the software with the malicious one and distributed it to millions of users for around a month.

This incident is yet another example of supply chain attack. Earlier this year, update servers of a Ukrainian company called MeDoc were also compromised in the same way to distribute the Petya ransomware, which wreaked havoc worldwide.

Avast and Piriform have both confirmed that the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware.

Detected on 13 September, the malicious version of CCleaner contains a multi-stage malware payload that steals data from infected computers and sends it to attacker's remote command-and-control servers.


Moreover, the unknown hackers signed the malicious installation executable (v5.33) using a valid digital signature issued to Piriform by Symantec and used Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), so that if attackers' server went down, the DGA could generate new domains to receive and send stolen information.

"All of the collected information was encrypted and encoded by base64 with a custom alphabet," says Paul Yung, V.P. of Products at Piriform. "The encoded information was subsequently submitted to an external IP address 216.126.x.x (this address was hardcoded in the payload, and we have intentionally masked its last two octets here) via a HTTPS POST request."

The malicious software was programmed to collect a large number of user data, including:


Computer name
List of installed software, including Windows updates
List of all running processes
IP and MAC addresses
Additional information like whether the process is running with admin privileges and whether it is a 64-bit system.



How to Remove Malware From Your PC

According to the Talos researchers, around 5 million people download CCleaner (or Crap Cleaner) each week, which indicates that more than 20 Million people could have been infected with the malicious version the app.


"The impact of this attack could be severe given the extremely high number of systems possibly affected. CCleaner claims to have over 2 billion downloads worldwide as of November 2016 and is reportedly adding new users at a rate of 5 million a week," Talos said.
However, Piriform estimated that up to 3 percent of its users (up to 2.27 million people) were affected by the malicious installation.

Affected users are strongly recommended to update their CCleaner software to version 5.34 or higher, in order to protect their computers from being compromised. The latest version is available for download here.

	      New Apache Struts Zero-Day Vulnerability Being Exploited in the Wild [1.0 Points on average]

Security researchers have discovered a Zero-Day vulnerability in the popular Apache Struts web application framework, which is being actively exploited in the wild.

Apache Struts is a free, open-source, Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for creating elegant, modern Java web applications, which supports REST, AJAX, and JSON.

In a blog post published Monday,<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco'</span>s Threat intelligence firm Talos announced the team observed a number of active attacks against the zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) in Apache Struts.

According to the researchers, the issue is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Jakarta Multipart parser of Apache Struts that could allow an attacker to execute malicious commands on the server when uploading files based on the parser.

"It is possible to perform an RCE attack with a malicious Content-Type value," warned Apache. "If the Content-Type value isn't valid an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user."
The vulnerability, documented at Rapid7's Metasploit Framework GitHub site, has been patched by Apache. So, if you are using the Jakarta-based file upload Multipart parser under Apache Struts 2, you are advised to upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1 immediately.


Exploit Code Publicly Released

Since the Talos researchers detected public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code (which was uploaded to a Chinese site), the vulnerability is quite dangerous.

The researchers even detected "a high number of exploitation events," the majority of which seem to be leveraging the publicly released PoC that is being used to run various malicious commands.


In some cases, the attackers executed simple "whoami" commands to see if the target system is vulnerable, while in others, the malicious attacks turned off firewall processes on the target and dropped payloads.




"Final steps include downloading a malicious payload from a web server and execution of said payload," the researchers say. "The payloads have varied but include an IRC bouncer, a DoS bot, and a sample related to the Bill Gates botnet... A payload is downloaded and executed from a privileged account."
Attackers also attempted to gain persistence on infected hosts by adding a binary to the boot-up routine.

According to the researchers, the attackers tried to copy the file to a benign directory and ensure "that both the executable runs and that the firewall service will be disabled when the system boots."

Both Cisco and Apache researchers urge administrators to upgrade their systems to Apache Struts version 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1 as soon as possible. Admins can also switch to a different implementation of the Multipart parser.

You won't believe your eyes while reading this, but this is true. Microsoft just joined the Linux Foundation as a high-paying Platinum member.

Microsoft's love with open source community is embracing as time passes. At its first Connect event in 2013, the company launched Visual Studio 2013. A year later, Microsoft open sourced .NET, and last year, it open sourced the Visual Studio Code Editor, as well.

Not just that, Microsoft partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu on Windows 10, worked with FreeBSD to develop a Virtual Machine image for its Azure cloud, and chosen Ubuntu as the OS for its Cloud-based Big Data services.


And the big news for this year is‚Ä¶

At its 2016 Connect developer event in New York today, Microsoft announced that the company is joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member ‚Äì the highest level of membership, which costs $500,000 annually.

Besides this, Microsoft also announced that tech giant Google has also joined on with the independent .NET Foundation.

The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit organization that oversees the development of the very popular free operating system Linux, alongside advances open technology development as well as commercial adoption.

Microsoft has already contributed to a number of its open source projects, including Node.js Foundation, Open Container Initiative, OpenDaylight, R Consortium, and Open API Initiative.

However, today's announcement from Microsoft still comes as a surprise to many, as Former Microsoft Chief Steve Ballmer once said, "Linux is a cancer,"¬†in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times.

Here's what Microsoft said in its latest announcement for joining the Linux Foundation:


"As part of its effort to work more closely with the open source community, Microsoft on Wednesday announced it has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member. Microsoft's membership in the Linux Foundation will benefit customers through increased collaboration and innovation among a diverse ecosystem."

Microsoft believes its latest move will benefit its customers through increased collaboration and innovation.

Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, also acknowledged the company's move to work more closely with the open-source community, saying:


"By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people. Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development."

Other Linux Foundation Platinum members include<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco,</span> Huawei, IBM, Intel, Oracle, Qualcomm, Samsung, Fujitsu, HPE, and NEC. While Gold sponsors include Google, Facebook and more than a dozen other prominent open source users.

Hey Webmasters, are you using Memcached to boost the performance of your website?

Beware! It might be vulnerable to remote hackers.

Three critical Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities have been reported in Memcached by security researcher Aleksandar Nikolich at<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>Talos Group that expose major websites, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, to hackers.

Memcached is a fabulous piece of open-source distributed caching system that allows objects to be stored in memory. It has been designed to speed up dynamic web applications by reducing stress on the database that helps administrators to increase performance and scale web applications.

Memcached is widely used by thousands upon thousands of websites, including popular social networking sites such as Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, Github, and many more.

Nikolich says that he discovered multiple integer overflow bugs in Memcached that could be exploited to remotely run arbitrary code on the targeted system, thereby compromising the many websites that expose Memcache servers accessible over the Internet.

The vulnerabilities actually reside in "various Memcached functions that are used in inserting, appending, prepending, or modifying key-value data pairs."

CVE-2016-8704: Memcached Server Append/Prepend Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2016-8705: Memcached Server Update Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2016-8706: Memcached Server SASL Authentication Remote Code Execution Vulnerability




Hackers Can Remotely Steal Sensitive Information

If exploited, the vulnerabilities could allow attackers to send repeat specifically-crafted Memcached commands to the targeted servers.

Moreover, the flaws could also be exploited to leak sensitive process information that can further be used to bypass standard exploitation mitigations, like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomisation), making the attacks reliable and considerably "severe."

By default, Memcached service installed on your server is available to the world on TCP port 11211, so it has always been strongly recommended to limit its access within a trusted environment, behind the firewall.

So, if you have not yet updated your software to the latest release and Memcached service is publically accessible, an attacker can simply exploit these vulnerabilities to remotely steal sensitive information cached by the server without your knowledge.

What's even worse? These flaws could allow hackers to replace cached content with their malicious one in order to deface the website, serve phishing pages and malicious links to hijack victim's machine, placing hundreds of millions of online users at risk.


Patch your Memcached Server Now!

The integer overflow flaws in Memcached affect Memcached version 1.4.31 and earlier.

The researcher notified Memcached of the flaws and the company only took two days to build a patch on 31st October.

Memcached says the critical remote code execution flaws "are related to the binary protocol as well as SASL authentication of the binary protocol," but has been fixed in the latest release.

Customers are advised to apply the patch even to Memcached deployments in "trusted" environments, as attackers with existing access could target vulnerable servers to move laterally within those networks.

It is no secret that cybercriminals are becoming dramatically more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day.

While new forms of cybercrime are on the rise, traditional activities seem to be shifting towards more clandestine techniques that involve the exploitation of standard system tools and protocols, which are not always monitored.

The latest example of such attack is DNSMessenger ‚Äì a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that uses DNS queries to conduct malicious PowerShell commands on compromised computers ‚Äì a technique that makes the RAT difficult to detect onto targeted systems.

The Trojan came to the attention of<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco'</span>s Talos threat research group by a security researcher named Simpo, who highlighted a tweet that encoded text in a PowerShell script that said 'SourceFireSux.' SourceFire is one of Cisco's corporate security products.


DNSMessenger Attack Is Completely Fileless

Further analysis of the malware ultimately led Talos researchers to discover a sophisticated attack comprising a malicious Word document and a PowerShell backdoor communicating with its command-and-control servers via DNS requests.

Distributed through an email phishing campaign, the DNSMessenger attack is completely Fileless, as it does not involve writing files to the targeted system; instead, it uses DNS TXT messaging capabilities to fetch malicious PowerShell commands stored remotely as DNS TXT records.

This feature makes it invisible to standard anti-malware defenses.

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language built into Windows that allows for the automation of system administration tasks.


The malicious Word document has been crafted "to appear as if it were associated with a secure e-mail service that is secured by McAfee," according to a blog post published by Talos researchers Edmund Brumaghin and Colin Grady on Thursday.


Here's How the DNSMessenger attack Works:

When opened, the document launches a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro to execute a self-contained PowerShell script in an attempt to run the backdoor onto the target system.

What's interesting? Everything, until this point, is done in memory, without writing any malicious files to the system's disk.

Next, the VBA script unpacks a compressed and sophisticated second stage of PowerShell, which involves checking for several parameters of the target environment, like the privileges of the logged-in user and the version of PowerShell installed on the target system.

This information is then used to ensure persistence on the infected host by changing the Windows Registry and installing a third stage PowerShell script that contains a simple backdoor.

The backdoor is being added to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) database, if the victim does have administrative access, allowing the malware backdoor to stay persistent on the system even after a reboot.

The backdoor is an additional script that establishes a sophisticated 2-way communications channel over the Domain Name System (DNS) ‚Äì usually used to look up the IP addresses associated with domain names, but has support for different types of records.

The DNSMessenger malware backdoor uses DNS TXT records that, by definition, allows a DNS server to attach unformatted text to a response.

The backdoor periodically sends DNS queries to one of a series of domains hard-coded in its source code. As part of those requests, it retrieves the domain's DNS TXT record, which contains further PowerShell commands that are executed but never written to the local system.

Now, this "fourth stage" Powershell script is the actual remote control tool used by the malware attacker.

This script queries the command-and-control servers via DNS TXT message requests to ask what commands to execute. Any command received is then executed, and the output is communicated back to the C&C server, allowing the attacker to execute any Windows or application commands on the infected system.

All attackers need to do is leave malicious commands and instructions inside the TXT records of their domains, which, when queried, is executed via the Windows Command Line Processor, and the output is sent back as another DNS query.

The domains registered by the DNSMessenger RAT are all down, so till now, it is not known that what types of commands the attackers relayed to infected systems. However, the researchers say this particular RAT was used in a small number of targeted attacks.

"This malware sample is an excellent example of the length attackers are willing to go to stay undetected while operating within the environments that they are targeting," the Talos researchers said.

"It also illustrates the importance that in addition to inspecting and filtering network protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/POP3, etc. DNS traffic within corporate networks should also be considered a channel that an attacker can use to implement a fully functional, bidirectional C2 infrastructure."
This is not the first time when the researchers came across a Fileless malware. At early last month, Kaspersky researchers also discovered fileless malware, that resides solely in the memory of the compromised computers, targeting banks, telecommunication companies, and government organizations in 40 countries.

Security researchers have discovered a critical remotely exploitable vulnerability in an open-source software development library used by major manufacturers of the Internet-of-Thing devices that eventually left millions of devices vulnerable to hacking.

The vulnerability (CVE-2017-9765), discovered by researchers at the IoT-focused security firm Senrio, resides in the software development library called gSOAP toolkit (Simple Object Access Protocol) ‚Äî an advanced C/C++ auto-coding tool for developing XML Web services and XML application.

Dubbed "Devil's Ivy," the stack buffer overflow vulnerability allows a remote attacker to crash the SOAP WebServices daemon and could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable devices.


The Devil's Ivy vulnerability was discovered by researchers while analysing an Internet-connected security camera manufactured by Axis Communications.

"When exploited, it allows an attacker to remotely access a video feed or deny the owner access to the feed," researchers say.¬†

"Since these cameras are meant to secure something, like a bank lobby, this could lead to collection of sensitive information or prevent a crime from being observed or recorded."

Axis confirmed the vulnerability that exists in almost all of its 250 camera models (you can find the complete list of affected camera models here) and has quickly released patched firmware updates on July 6th to address the vulnerability, prompting partners and customers to upgrade as soon as possible.

However, researchers believe that their exploit would work on internet-connected devices from other vendors as well, as the affected software is used by Canon, Siemens,<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco,</span> Hitachi, and many others.

Axis immediately informed Genivia, the company that maintains gSOAP, about the vulnerability and Genivia released a patch on June 21, 2017.

The company also reached out to electronics industry consortium ONVIF to ensure all of its members, including Canon, Cisco, and Siemens, those who make use of¬†gSOAP¬†become aware of the issue and can develop patches to fix the security hole.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices has always been the weakest link and, therefore, an easy entry for hackers to get into secured networks. So it is always advisable to keep your Internet-connected devices updated and away from the public Internet.

Last week, a group calling itself "The Shadow Brokers" published what it said was a set of NSA "cyber weapons," including some working exploits for the Internet's most crucial network infrastructure, apparently stolen from the agency's Equation Group in 2013.

Well, talking about the authenticity of those exploits, The Intercept published Friday a new set of documents from the Edward Snowden archive, which confirms that the files leaked by the Shadow Brokers contain authentic NSA software and hacking tools used to secretly infect computers worldwide.

As I previously mentioned, the leaked documents revealed how the NSA was systematically spying on customers of big technology companies like<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco,</span> Fortinet, and Juniper for at least a decade.

Hacking tools from The Shadow Brokers leak named ExtraBacon, EpicBanana, and JetPlow, contain exploits that can compromise Cisco firewall products including devices from the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) line, PIX firewalls, and Cisco Firewall Services Modules (FWSM).

After a thorough investigation, Cisco confirmed the authenticity of these exploits, saying that these hacking tools contain exploits that leverage two security vulnerabilities affecting Cisco ASA software designed to protect corporate and government networks and data centers.


ExtraBacon Zero-Day Cisco Exploit

A zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2016-6366) leveraged by ExtraBacon Exploit resides in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco ASA software that could allow "an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system," Cisco explained in its advisory.

This leads to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, enabling a remote attacker to take complete control over the device.

ExtraBacon was a zero-day exploit that was unknown to Cisco that left customers open to attack by hackers, in this case, NSA as well, who possessed the right hacking tools.

Besides ExtraBacon zero-day exploit, Cisco researchers also found a piece of code that tried to exploit an older Cisco bug (CVE-2016-6367) that was patched in 2011.

Also Read:¬†How NSA successfully Broke Trillions of Encrypted Connections.

The flaw resided in the command-line interface (CLI) parser of Cisco ASA software that allowed "an authenticated, local attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code [on the vulnerable device]," Cisco explained.

This flaw was included inside two NSA exploits, dubbed EPICBANANA as well as JETPLOW, which is an enhanced version of EPICBANANA, but with better persistence capabilities, Cisco's Omar Santos said in a blog post.


In addition, the leaked data contains files for decrypting Cisco PIX¬†Virtual Private Network (VPN) traffic, and implanting malware in computer motherboard firmware in such a way that it's almost impossible to detect or delete.

The multi-billion dollar tech firm has provided workarounds that addressed the vulnerabilities, though planned to release software updates to address the issues completely as soon as possible.


Fortinet says, Exploits Disclosed in 'NSA hack' are Legit

Meanwhile, another firewall equipment vendor, Fortinet, also warned of a high-risk vulnerability included in the EGREGIOUSBLUNDER exploit leaked by The Shadow Brokers, which affects older versions of its FortiGate firewalls.

The flaw resides in the onboard cookie parser buffer that could allow an attacker to take over an affected device by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.

Fortinet recommended its customers and businesses to upgrade to FortiGuard versions 5.x. However, Juniper has yet to issue security advisories based on the leaked files in the data dump.


Who is the 'The Shadow Brokers'? Russia? An Insider?

How the files containing exploits were leaked, and who exactly leaked it, are still unclear, but the recent developments made it very much clear that these exploits belong to the NSA and the agency was using them to target customers worldwide.

The Shadow Brokers' identity is still a mystery: As for now, multiple theories have been proposed.

Some are pointing their fingers towards Russia; some are saying it's an insider's job; while some say the NSA hacker using the hacking tools failed to clean up after an operation that allowed someone to grab them without compromising or hacking the agency.

Yes, you only need a single laptop with a decent internet connection, rather a massive botnet, to launch overwhelming denial of service (DoS) attacks in order to bring down major Internet servers and modern-day firewalls.

Researchers at TDC Security Operations Center have discovered a new attack technique that lone attackers with limited resources (in this case, a laptop and at least 15Mbps of bandwidth) can use to knock large servers offline.

Dubbed a BlackNurse attack or the low-rate "Ping of Death" attack, the technique can be used to launch several low-volume DoS attacks by sending specially formed Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets, or 'pings' that overwhelm the processors on server protected by firewalls from<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco,</span> Palo Alto Networks, among others.

ICMP is a protocol used by routers and other networking devices to send and receive error messages.

According to a technical report [PDF] published this week, the BlackNurse attack is more traditionally known as a "ping flood attack" and is based on ICMP Type 3 (Destination Unreachable) Code 3 (Port Unreachable) requests.

These requests are packet replies typically returned to ping sources when the destination port of a target is 'unreachable.'


Here's How the BlackNurse attack Works:

By sending a Type 3 ICMP packets with a code of 3, a hacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) state by overloading the CPUs of certain types of server firewalls, regardless of the quality of internet connection.

The BlackNurse traffic volume is very small, ranging from 15 Mbps to 18 Mbps (or about 40,000 to 50,000 packets per second), which is laughable compared to record-breaking 1.1 Tbps DDoS attack recorded against French Internet service provider OVH in September.

However, TDC explained this was not the problem, as the major issue is a steady stream of 40K to 50K ICMP packets that reach the victim's network equipment and keep crashing the target device.

The good news? The researcher said, "When an attack is ongoing, users from the LAN side will no longer be able to send/receive traffic to/from the Internet. All firewalls we've have seen recover when the attack stops."

In other words, this low-volume DoS technique remains effective because it is not flooding the firewall with traffic, but rather it is pushing high load onto the CPU, effectively knocking servers offline even if they've tons of network capacity.

Researchers said BlackNurse should not be confused with 'ping flood attacks based on ICMP Type 8 Code 0' ‚Äì regular ping traffic. Researchers explain:

"The BlackNurse attack attracted our attention because in our anti-DDoS solution we experienced that even though traffic speed and packets per second were very low, this attack could keep our customers' operations down."¬†

"This even applied to customers with large internet uplinks and large enterprise firewalls in place. We had expected that professional firewall equipment would be able to handle the attack."


Products Affected

The BlackNurse attack works against the following products:

Cisco ASA 5506, 5515, 5525 (default settings)
Cisco ASA 5550 (legacy) and 5515-X (latest generation)
Cisco Router 897 (can be mitigated)
SonicWall (misconfiguration can be changed and mitigated)
Some unverified Palo Alto
Zyxel NWA3560-N (wireless attack from LAN side)
Zyxel Zywall USG50


How to Mitigate the BlackNurse Attack?

The good news? There are ways to fight back the BlackNurse attacks.

TDC suggested some mitigations and SNORT IDS rules that could be used to detect BlackNurse attacks. Moreover, proof-of-concept (PoC) code posted by an OVH security engineer on GitHub can also be used by network admins to test their equipment against BlackNurse.

In order to mitigate the BlackNurse attacks on firewalls and other equipment, TDC recommended users to configure a list of trusted sources for which ICMP is allowed. However, the best way to mitigate the attack is to simply disable ICMP Type 3 Code 3 on the WAN interface.

Palo Alto Networks has also issued an advisory, saying that its devices are only affected in "very specific, non-default scenarios that contravene best practices." The company also lists some recommendations for its customers.

Meanwhile, Cisco said it does not consider the reported behavior to be a security issue, warning:

"We recommend that you grant permission for the ICMP unreachable message type (type 3). Denying ICMP unreachable messages disables ICMP Path MTU discovery, which can halt IPSec and PPTP traffic."
Moreover, independent software vendor NETRESEC also published a detailed analysis of BlackNurse in its post titled, "The 90's called and wanted their ICMP flood attack back."

Besides all these, the Sans Institute has also issued its own brief write-up on the BlackNurse attack, discussing the attack and what users should do in order to mitigate it.

	      Equifax Suffered Data Breach After It Failed to Patch Old Apache Struts Flaw [1.02 Points on average]

The massive Equifax data breach that exposed highly sensitive data of as many as 143 million people was caused by exploiting a flaw in Apache Struts framework, which Apache patched over two months earlier of the security incident, Equifax has confirmed.

Credit rating agency Equifax is yet another example of the companies that became victims of massive cyber attacks due to not patching a critical vulnerability on time, for which patches were already issued by the respected companies.

Rated critical with a maximum 10.0 score, the Apache Struts2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) exploited in the Equifax breach was disclosed and fixed by Apache on March 6 with the release of Apache Struts version 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1.

This flaw is separate from CVE-2017-9805, another Apache Struts2 vulnerability that was patched earlier this month, which was a programming bug that manifests due to the way Struts REST plugin handles XML payloads while deserializing them, and was¬†fixed in Struts version 2.5.13.

Right after the disclosure of the vulnerability, hackers started actively exploiting the flaw in the wild to install rogue applications on affected web servers after its proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code was uploaded to a Chinese site.

Despite patches were made available and proofs that the flaw was already under mass attack by hackers, Equifax failed to patched its Web applications against the flaw, which resulted in the breach of personal data of nearly half of the US population.

"Equifax has been intensely investigating the scope of the intrusion with the assistance of a leading, independent cyber security firm to determine what information was accessed and who have been impacted," the company officials wrote in an update on the website with a new "A Progress Update for Consumers."¬†

"We know that criminals exploited a US website application vulnerability. The vulnerability was Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638. We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation, and have shared indicators of compromise with law enforcement."
CVE-2017-5638 was a then-zero-day vulnerability discovered in the popular Apache Struts web application framework by<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco'</span>s Threat intelligence firm Talos, which observed a number of active attacks exploiting the flaw.

The issue was a remote code execution bug in the Jakarta Multipart parser of Apache Struts2 that could allow an attacker to execute malicious commands on the server when uploading files based on the parser.

At the time, Apache warned it was possible to perform a remote code execution attack with "a malicious Content-Type value," and if this value is not valid "an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user."

For those unaware, Apache Struts is a free, open-source MVC framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language that run both front-end and back-end Web servers. The framework is used by 65n per cent of the Fortune 100 companies, including Lockheed Martin, Vodafone, Virgin Atlantic, and the IRS.

Since the hackers are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities in the Apache Struts web framework, Cisco has also initiated an investigation into its products against four newly discovered security vulnerabilities in Apache Struts2.

Other companies that also incorporate a version of Apache Struts 2 should¬†also check their infrastructures against these vulnerabilities.

Equifax is currently offering free credit-monitoring and identity theft protection services for people who are affected by the massive data leak and has also enabled a security freeze for access to people's information.

While the company was initially criticised for generating a PIN that was simply a time and date stamp and easy-to-guess, the PIN generation method was later changed to randomly generate numbers.

Last year Google employees took an initiative to help thousands of Open Source Projects patch a critical remote code execution vulnerability in a widely used Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library.

Dubbed Operation Rosehub, the initiative was volunteered by some 50 Google employees, who utilized 20 percent of their work time to patch over 2600 open source projects on Github, those were vulnerable to "Mad Gadget vulnerability."

Mad Gadget vulnerability (CVE-2015-6420) is a remote code execution bug in the Java deserialization used by the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a system.

The ACC Library is widely deployed by many Java applications to decode data passed between computers. To exploit this flaw, all an unauthorized attacker need to do is submit maliciously crafted input to an application on a targeted system that uses the ACC library.

Once the vulnerable ACC library on the affected system deserializes the content, the attacker could remotely execute arbitrary code on the compromised system, which could then be used to conduct further attacks.

Remember ransomware attack on Muni Metro System? Late last year, an anonymous hacker managed to infect and take over more than 2,000 computers using this same Mad Gadget flaw in the software used to operate San Francisco's public transport system.

Following the public disclosure of the Mad Gadget flaw, almost every commercial enterprise including Oracle,<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco,</span> Red Hat, VMWare, IBM, Intel, Adobe, HP, Jenkins, and SolarWinds formally disclosed that they had been impacted by this vulnerability and patched it in their software.

However, few months after all big businesses patched the flaw, one of the Google employees noticed that several prominent open source libraries were still depending on the vulnerable versions of ACC library.

"We recognized that the industry best practices had failed. An action was needed to keep the open source community safe. So rather than simply posting a security advisory asking everyone to address the vulnerability, we formed a task force to update their code for them. That initiative was called Operation Rosehub," Justine Tunney, Software Engineer on TensorFlow, wrote on Google Open Source Blog.
Under Operation Rosehub, patches were sent to many open source projects, although the Google employees were only able to patch open source projects on GitHub that directly referenced vulnerable versions of ACC library.

According to the Open Source Blog, if the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency's software systems had been open source, Google engineers would also have been able to deliver patches for Mad Gadget to them, and their systems would have never been compromised.

<span class="highlight-match">
Cisco </span>is warning of a new critical zero-day IOS / IOS XE vulnerability that affects more than 300 of its switch models.

The company identified this highest level of vulnerability in its product while analyzing "Vault 7" ‚Äî a roughly 8,761 documents and files leaked by Wikileaks last week, claiming to detail hacking tools and tactics of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

The vulnerability resides in the Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software.

If exploited, the flaw (CVE-2017-3881) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reboot of an affected device or remotely execute malicious code on the device with elevated privileges to take full control of the device, Cisco says in its¬†advisory.

The CMP protocol has been designed to pass around information about switch clusters between cluster members using Telnet or SSH.

The vulnerability is in the default configuration of affected Cisco devices, even if the user doesn't configure any cluster configuration commands. The flaw can be exploited during Telnet session negotiation over either IPv4 or IPv6.

According to the Cisco researchers, this bug occurs in Telnet connections within the CMP, due to two factors:


The protocol doesn't restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members; instead, it accepts and processes commands over any Telnet connection to an affected device.
The incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options.


So, in order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can send "malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections," researchers say.

This exploitation could allow the attacker to remotely execute malicious code and obtain full control of the affected device or cause a reload of the affected device.


Disable Telnet On Vulnerable Models ‚Äî Patch is not Available Yet!

The vulnerability affects 264 Catalyst switches, 51 industrial Ethernet switches, and 3 other devices, which includes Catalyst switches, Embedded Service 2020 switches, Enhanced Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module, Enhanced Layer 2 EtherSwitch Service Module, ME 4924-10GE switch, IE Industrial Ethernet switches, RF Gateway 10, SM-X Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module, and Gigabit Ethernet Switch Module (CGESM) for HP. (check complete list here)

Currently, this vulnerability is unpatched, and until patches are available, Cisco recommends its users to disable the Telnet connection to the switch devices in favor of SSH.

The company's advisory doesn't talk about any working exploit using this flaw, but if there's one, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of devices installed around the world look to have been at great risk for an unknown period ‚Äî Thanks to the CIA for holding the flaw.

Cisco will update its IOS Software Checker tool immediately as soon as the patches come out.

Researchers have disclosed a critical zero-day vulnerability in the JPEG 2000 image file format parser implemented in OpenJPEG library, which could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the affected systems.

Discovered by security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>Talos group, the zero-day flaw, assigned as TALOS-2016-0193/CVE-2016-8332, could allow an out-of-bound heap write to occur that triggers the heap corruption and leads to arbitrary code execution.

OpenJPEG is an open-source JPEG 2000 codec. Written in C language, the software was developed for coding and encoding JPEG2000 images, a format that is often used for tasks like embedding image files within PDF documents through popular software including PdFium, Poppler, and MuPDF.

Hackers can exploit the security vulnerability by tricking the victim into opening a specially crafted, malicious JPEG2000 image or a PDF document containing that malicious file in an email.

The hacker could even upload the malicious JPEG2000 image file to a file hosting service, like Dropbox or Google Drive, and then send that link to the victim.

Once downloaded to the system, it would create a way for hackers to remotely execute malicious code on the affected system.

The flaw was caused "due to an error while parsing mcc records in the jpeg2000 file,...resulting in an erroneous read and write of adjacent heap area memory," Cisco explained in its advisory.

"Careful manipulation of heap layout and can lead to further heap metadata process memory corruption ultimately leading to code execution under attacker control."

The researchers successfully tested the JPEG 2000 image exploit on the OpenJPEG openjp2 version 2.1.1. The flaw was discovered by Aleksandar Nikolic from the Cisco Talos Security team.

The team reported the zero-day flaw to OpenJPEG developers in late July, and the company patched the flaw last week with the release of version 2.1.2.

The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.5, categorizing it as a high-severity bug.

Here we are with our weekly roundup, briefing this week's top cyber security threats, incidents and challenges.

This week has been very short with big news from shutting down of two of the largest Dark Web marketplaces and theft of millions of dollars in the popular Ethereum cryptocurrency to the discovery of new Linux malware leveraging SambaCry exploit.

We are here with the outline of this week's stories, just in case you missed any of them. We recommend you read the entire thing (just click 'Read More' because there's some valuable advice in there as well).

Here's the list of this Week's Top Stories:


1. Feds Shuts Down AlphaBay and Hansa Dark Web Markets ‚Äî Dream Market Under Suspicion

On Thursday, Europol announced that the authorities had shut down two of the largest criminal Dark Web markets ‚Äî AlphaBay and Hansa ‚Äî in what's being called the largest-ever international operation against the dark web's black market conducted by the FBI, DEA and Dutch National Police.

Interestingly, the federal authorities shut down AlphaBay, but before taking down Hansa market, they took control of the Dark Web market and kept it running for at least a month in an effort to monitor the activities of its visitors, including a massive flood of Alphabay refugees.

After the shutdown of both AlphaBay and Hansa, Dream Market has emerged as the leading player, which has been in business since 2013, but it has now been speculated by many dark web users that Dream Market is also under police control.

Is your router collects data on your network?

Netgear last week pushed out a firmware update for its wireless router model NightHawk R7000 with a remote data collection feature that collects router's analytics data and sends it to the company's server.

For now, the company has rolled out the firmware update for its NightHawk R7000, but probably other router models would receive the update in upcoming days.

The Netgear's alleged router analytics data collects information regarding:


Total number of devices connected to the router
IP address
MAC addresses
Serial number
Router's running status
Types of connections
LAN/WAN status
Wi-Fi bands and channels
Technical details about the use and functioning of the router and the WiFi network.


The company said it is collecting the data for routine diagnostic to know how its products are used and how its routers behave.

"Technical data about the functioning and use of our routers and their WiFi network can help us to more quickly isolate and debug general technical issues, improve router features and functionality, and improve the performance and usability of our routers," Netgear said on its website.

How to Disable your Router Analytics Data Collection Feature

But if you are privacy conscious and don't want Netgear to collect details on you, you can disable this feature.

The company has provided an option in the router's configuration panel to turn the router analytics data collection feature off. Follow the instructions:


Launch a web browser from your PC or smartphone that is connected to the network.
Open the router login window by entering http://www.routerlogin.net.
Type the router username and password. If you haven't changed the default settings, your username is admin, and password is password.
Select Advanced ‚Üí Administration ‚Üí Router Update on the Home page.
Scroll down to the Router Analytics Data Collection section and select the Disable button to disable router analytics data collections.
Click the Apply button to save your settings.


That's it. You're done.


Boost And Secure Your Routers With DD-WRT


Alternatively, you can replace your device firmware with¬†DD-WRT ‚Äì a Linux-based open source firmware that is designed to enhance security and performance of wireless Internet routers.

Security conscious people always prefer DD-WRT firmware over their factory default firmware, which is compatible with many router models from popular manufacturers such as LinkSys,<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco,</span> Netgear, Asus, TP-Link, D-Link and more.

DD-WRT has a ton of features ‚Äì it improves your wireless signal, as well as unlocks your router's potential to manage network traffic, static routing, VPN, repeating functions and more.

To check if your router is compatible with DD-WRT, head on to 'DD-WRT database'¬†and search for your router model number.



If it's there and supported, then download it and follow below-mentioned general steps to install it:

Log into your router's admin page (usually at http://192.168.1.1/).
Go to the Admin section and choose "Firmware Upgrade."
Choose "Select File" and find your DD-WRT firmware.
Upload it and do not unplug or do anything to the router until it finishes updating.

Note: Changing your router's firmware with a non-compatible firmware can brick your router. So be very careful.

After Equifax massive data breach that was believed to be caused due to a vulnerability in Apache Struts,<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>has initiated an investigation into its products that incorporate a version of the popular Apache Struts2 web application framework.

Apache Struts is a free, open-source MVC framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language, and used by 65 percent of the Fortune 100 companies, including Lockheed Martin, Vodafone, Virgin Atlantic, and the IRS.

However, the popular open-source software package was recently found affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including two remote code execution vulnerabilities‚Äîone discovered earlier this month, and another in March‚Äîone of which is believed to be used to breach personal data of over 143 million Equifax users.

Some of Cisco products including its Digital Media Manager, MXE 3500 Series Media Experience Engines, Network Performance Analysis, Hosted Collaboration Solution for Contact Center, and Unified Contact Center Enterprise¬†have¬†been¬†found vulnerable to multiple Apache Struts flaws.


Cisco Launches Apache Struts Vulnerability Hunting

Cisco is also testing rest of its products against four newly discovered security vulnerability in Apache Struts2, including the one (CVE-2017-9805) we reported on September 5 and the remaining three also disclosed last week.

However, the remote code execution bug (CVE-2017-5638) that was actively exploited back in March this year is not included by the company in its recent security audit.

The three vulnerabilities‚ÄîCVE-2017-9793, CVE-2017-9804 and CVE-2017-9805‚Äîincluded in the Cisco security audit was released by the Apache Software Foundation on 5th September with the release of Apache Struts 2.5.13 which patched the issues.

The fourth vulnerability (CVE-2017-12611) that is being investigated by Cisco was released on 7th September with the release of Apache Struts 2.3.34 that fixed the flaw that resided in the Freemarker tag functionality of the Apache Struts2 package and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute malicious code on an affected system.


Apache Struts Flaw Actively Exploited to Hack Servers & Deliver Malware

Coming on to the most severe of all, CVE-2017-9805 (assigned as critical) is a programming bug that manifests due to the way Struts REST plugin handles XML payloads while deserializing them.

This could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution on a host running a vulnerable version of Apache Struts2, and Cisco's Threat intelligence firm Talos has¬†observed¬†that this flaw is¬†under active exploitation¬†to find vulnerable servers.

Security researchers from data centre security vendor Imperva recently detected and blocked thousands of attacks attempting to exploit this Apache Struts2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-9805), with roughly 80 percent of them tried to deliver a malicious payload.

The majority of attacks originated from China with a single Chinese IP address registered to a Chinese e-commerce company sending out more than 40% of all the requests. Attacks also came from Australia, the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Russia and various parts of Europe.

Out of the two remaining flaws, one (CVE-2017-9793) is again a vulnerability in the REST plug-in for Apache Struts that manifests due to "insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the XStream library in the REST plug-in for the affected application."

This flaw has been given a Medium severity and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on targeted systems.

The last flaw (CVE-2017-9804) also allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system but resides in the URLValidator feature of Apache Struts.

Cisco is testing its products against these vulnerabilities including its WebEx Meetings Server, the Data Center Network Manager, Identity Services Engine (ISE), MXE 3500 Series Media Experience Engines, several Cisco Prime products, some products for voice and unified communications, as well as video and streaming services.

At the current, there are no software patches to address the vulnerabilities in Cisco products, but the company promised to release updates for affected software which will soon be accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool.

Since the framework is being widely used by a majority of top 100 fortune companies, they should also check their infrastructures against these vulnerabilities that incorporate a version of Apache Struts2.

Recently released NSA exploit from "The Shadow Brokers" leak that affects older versions of<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>System firewalls can work against newer models as well.

Dubbed ExtraBacon, the exploit was restricted to versions 8.4.(4) and earlier versions of Cisco's Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) ‚Äì a line of firewalls designed to protect corporate, government networks and data centers.

However, the exploit has now been expanded to 9.2.(4) after researchers from Hungary-based security consultancy SilentSignal were able to modify the code of ExtraBacon to make it work on a much newer version of Cisco's ASA software.

Both Cisco and Fortinet have confirmed their firewalls are affected by exploits listed in the Shadow Brokers cache that contained a set of "cyber weapons" stolen from the Equation Group.

The Equation Group is an elite hacking group tied to the NSA's offensive Tailored Access Operations (TAO) and linked to the previous infamous Regin and Stuxnet attacks.


As previously reported, the ExtraBacon exploit leveraged a zero-day vulnerability in the Simple Network Messaging Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco‚Äôs ASA software that could allow "an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system" and take full control of a firewall.

However, newly released exploit means that ExtraBacon poses a dangerous threat than previously thought, as the modified exploit now does not prevent it from running on newer versions of Cisco firewalls, allowing an attacker to execute malicious code remotely.

"We have test equipment and custom firmware images that make debugging easier," Varga-Perke of SilentSignal told Ars. "These are most likely available for malicious parties, too; we are quite confident that similar code exists in private hands."
Cisco engineers have provided workarounds that help ASA customers detect and stop ExtraBacon-powered attacks, though the multi-billion dollar company has yet to release software updates to address the flaw completely.

Just like researchers modified the exploit code to make it work on newer version of Cisco products, the hacking tools and exploits dumped by the Shadow Brokers could be exploited by a wide range of hackers to carry out advanced attacks.

Nothing in this world is fully secure, from our borders to cyberspace. I know vulnerabilities are bad, but the worst part comes in when people just don't care to apply patches on time.

Late last year,<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco'</span>s Talos intelligence and research group discovered three critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Memcached that exposed major websites including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, to hackers.

Memcached is a popular open-source and easily deployable distributed caching system that allows objects to be stored in memory.

The Memcached application has been designed to speed up dynamic web applications (for example php-based websites) by reducing stress on the database that helps administrators to increase performance and scale web applications.

It's been almost eight months since the Memcached developers have released patches for three critical RCE vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-8704, CVE-2016-8705 and CVE-2016-8706) but tens of thousands of servers running Memcached application are still vulnerable, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data remotely.

Researchers at Talos conducted Internet scans on two different occasions, one in late February and another in July, to find out how many servers are still running the vulnerable version of the Memcached application.

And the results are surprising...


Results from February Scan:



Total servers exposed on the Internet ‚Äî 107,786
Servers still vulnerable ‚Äî 85,121
Servers still vulnerable but require authentication ‚Äî 23,707



And the top 5 countries with most vulnerable servers are the United States, followed by China, United Kingdom, France and Germany.


Results from July Scan:



Total servers exposed on the Internet ‚Äî 106,001
servers still vulnerable ‚Äî 73,403
Servers still vulnerable but require authentication ‚Äî 18,012



After comparing results from both the Internet scans, researchers learned that only 2,958 servers found vulnerable in February scan had been patched before July scan, while the remaining are still left vulnerable to the remote hack.


Data Breach & Ransom Threats

This ignorance by organisations to apply patches on time is concerning, as Talos researchers warned that these vulnerable Memcached installations could be an easy target of ransomware attacks¬†similar to the one that hit MongoDB databases in late December.

Although unlike MongoDB, Memcached is not a database, it "can still contain sensitive information and disruption in the service availability would certainly lead to further disruptions on dependent services."

The flaws in Memcached could allow hackers to replace cached content with their malicious one to deface the website, serve phishing pages, ransom threats, and malicious links to hijack victim's machine, placing hundreds of millions of online users at risk.


"With the recent spate of worm attacks leveraging vulnerabilities this should be a red flag for administrators around the world," the researchers concluded.


"If left unaddressed the vulnerabilities could be leveraged to impact organisations globally and affect business severely. It is highly recommended that these systems be patched immediately to help mitigate the risk to organisations."

Customers and organisations are advised to apply the patch as soon as possible even to Memcached deployments in "trusted" environments, as attackers with existing access could target vulnerable servers to move laterally within those networks.

This newly discovered bugs in Java and Python is a big deal today.

The two popular programming languages, Java and Python, contain similar security flaws that can be exploited to send unauthorized emails and bypass any firewall defenses.

And since both the flaws remain unpatched, hackers can take advantage to design potential cyber attack operations against critical networks and infrastructures.

The unpatched flaws actually reside in the way Java and Python programming languages handle File Transfer Protocol (FTP) links, where they don't syntax-check the username parameter, which leads to, what researchers call, protocol injection flaw.


Java/Python FTP Injection to Send Unauthorized SMTP Emails


In a blog post published over the past week, security researcher Alexander Klink detailed the FTP protocol injection vulnerability in Java's XML eXternal Entity (XXE) that allows attackers to inject non-FTP malicious commands inside an FTP connection request.

To demonstrate the attack, Alexander showed how to send an unauthorized email via SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) in an FTP connection attempt, even though the FTP connection failed, as FTP servers does support authentication, but doesn't check for the present of carriage returns (CR) or line feeds (LF) in usernames.

"This attack is particularly interesting in a scenario where you can reach an (unrestricted, maybe not even spam- or malware-filtering) internal mail server from the machine doing the XML parsing," Alexander concluded.


Java/Python FTP Injections Allow to Bypass Firewall

However, two days later in a separate security advisory, security researcher Timothy Morgan from Blindspot Security came forward with his findings, showing more threatening exploitation scenario where the FTP URL handlers in both Java and Python can be used to bypass firewalls.

Morgan said such FTP protocol injection flaw could be used to trick a victim's firewall into accepting TCP connections from the web to the vulnerable host's system on its "high" ports (from 1024 to 65535).

Besides the FTP protocol injection attack, there's reside a decade old security issue in FTP protocol called classic mode FTP ‚Äì an insecure mechanism of client-server FTP interactions, but many firewall vendors still support it by default.

When a classic mode FTP connection is initiated, the firewall temporarily opens a port ‚Äì typically between 1024 and 65535 ‚Äì specified in the PORT command, which introduces security risks.

Using the FTP protocol injection issue in Java and Python, an attacker who knows the targeted host‚Äôs internal IP address can start a classic mode FTP connection, which attackers can use for nefarious purposes.

Morgan has determined that an attacker can open up one port in the targeted firewall with only three requests:

Identify the victim's internal IP address ‚Äì this requires an attacker to "send an URL, see how the client behaves, then try another until the attack is successful."
Determine packet alignment and ensure that the PORT command is injected at the right moment, making the attack work.
Exploit the vulnerability.


Each additional request can be used to open up another TCP port.


Easily Exploitable Protocol Injection Flaw

However, the researcher warned that his exploit could be used for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, server-side request forgery (SSRF), an XEE attack and more ‚Äì and once bypassed the firewall, desktop hosts can be attacked even if they do not have Java installed.

All an attacker need is to convince victims into accessing a malicious Java or Python applications installed on a server to bypass the entire firewall.

"If a desktop user could be convinced to visit a malicious website while Java is installed, even if Java applets are disabled, they could still trigger Java Web Start to parse a JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol) file," Morgan said. "These files could contain malicious FTP URLs which trigger this bug."

"Also note, that since Java parses JNLP files before presenting the user with any security warnings, the attack can be entirely successful without any indication to the user (unless the browser itself warns the user about Java Web Start being launched)."
According to Morgan, a nearly identical flaw also exists in Python's urllib2 and urllib libraries, although "this injection appears to be limited to attacks via directory names specified in the URL."


Protocol Injection Flaw Is Still Unpatched

Morgan said the FTP protocol injection flaw was reported to the Python team in January 2016 and Oracle in November 2016 by his company, but neither of the two has issued any update to address the issue.

Morgan has developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit but is currently holding back publication of his exploit until Oracle and Python respond to the disclosure and release patches.

The Morgan's exploit has successfully been tested against Palo Alto Networks and<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>ASA firewalls, though researchers believe many commercial firewalls are also vulnerable to FTP stream injection attacks.

So until patches become available, Morgan suggests users uninstall Java on their desktops and in browsers, as well as disable support for "classic mode" FTP on all firewalls.

Ransomware threat has risen exponentially so much that ransomware authors have started abusing the MBR in their attacks to lock down your entire computer instead of just encrypting your important files on hard drive.

Talos team at<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>Systems has released a free, open-source tool that protects the master boot record (MBR) sector of computers from modification by bootkits, ransomware, and other malicious attacks.

Master Boot Record (MBR) is the first sector (512 bytes) on your Hard drive that stores the bootloader, a piece of code that is responsible for booting the current Operating System.

Technically, Bootloader is first code that gets executed after system BIOS that tells your computer what to do when it start.

An advanced malware program, such as rootkit and bootkit, leverages this process to infect computers by modifying the MBR.

A boot malware or bootkits has the ability to install ransomware or other malicious software into your Windows kernel, which is almost impossible to detect, and thus takes unrestricted and unauthorized access to your entire computer.

So, the best way to protect your computer against such bootkits is to restrict your MBR to rewrite or overwrite by an unauthorized software.

Cisco's Talos team free tool does the same.

Dubbed MBRFilter, the tool is nothing more than a signed system driver that puts the MBR into a read-only state, preventing any software or malware from modifying data of the MBR section.

You can watch the video demonstration of MBRFilter in action.


MBRFilter will safeguard your computer against MBR-targeting malware, like the Petya ransomware, Satana, or HDDCryptor ransomware.

"MBRFilter is a simple disk filter based on Microsoft‚Äôs diskperf and classpnp example drivers," the team said in a blog post. "It can be used to prevent malware from writing to Sector 0 on all disk devices connected to a system. Once installed, the system will need to be booted into Safe Mode in order for Sector 0 of the disk to become accessible for modification."
MBRFilter is available for both Windows 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and Cisco has open-sourced its source code on GitHub.

It seems like the NSA has been HACKED!

Update: The NSA Hack ‚Äî What, When, Where, How, Who & Why? Explained Here.

An unknown hacker or a group of hackers just claimed to have hacked into "Equation Group" -- a cyber-attack group allegedly associated with the United States intelligence organization NSA -- and dumped a bunch of its hacking tools (malware, private exploits, and hacking tools) online.

I know, it is really hard to believe, but some cybersecurity experts who have been examining the leak data, exploits and hacking tools, believe it to be legitimate.

Hacker Demands $568 Million in Bitcoin to Leak All Tools and Data

Not just this, the hackers, calling themselves "The Shadow Brokers," are also asking for 1 Million Bitcoins (around $568 Million) in an auction to release the 'best' cyber weapons and more files.

Widely believed to be part of the NSA, Equation Group was described as "a threat actor that surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques, and that has been active for almost two decades," according to a report published by security firm Kaspersky in 2015.

Equation Group was also linked to the previous infamous Regin and Stuxnet attacks, allegedly the United States sponsored hacks, though the link was never absolutely proven.

Two days back, The Shadow Brokers released some files, which it claimed came from the Equation Group, on Github¬†(deleted) and Tumblr.


Exploits for American & Chinese Firewalls Leaked:

The files mostly contained installation scripts, configurations for command-and-control (C&C) servers, and exploits allegedly designed to target routers and firewalls from American manufacturers including,<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco,</span> Juniper, and Fortinet.

According to the leaked files, Chinese company 'Topsec' was also an Equation Group target.

The leak mentioned names of some of the hacking tools that correlate with names used in the documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, like "BANANAGLEE" and "EPICBANANA."

"We follow Equation Group traffic," says the Shadow Broker. "We find Equation Group source range. We hack Equation Group. We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons. You see pictures. We give you some Equation Group files free, you see. This is good proof no? You enjoy!!! You break many things. You find many intrusions. You write many words. But not all, we are auction the best files."
It is yet not confirmed whether the leaked documents are legitimate or not, but some security experts agree that it likely is.

"I haven't tested the exploits, but they definitely look like legitimate exploits," Matt Suiche, founder of UAE-based cyber security firm Comae Technologies, told the Daily Dot.

While some are saying that the leak could be a very well-researched hoax, and the Bitcoin auction could be nothing but a distraction in an attempt to gain media attention.

"If this is a hoax, the perpetrators put a huge amount of effort in," security researcher The Grugq told Motherboard. "The proof files look pretty legit, and they are exactly the sorts of exploits you would expect a group that targets communications infrastructure to deploy and use."
However, if NSA has successfully been hacked, the hack would be a highly critical cyber security incident.

<span class="highlight-match">
Cisco </span>Systems has finally released an update for its IOS and IOS XE software to address a critical vulnerability, disclosed nearly two months back in the CIA Vault 7 leak, that affects more than 300 of its switch models.

The company identified the vulnerability in its product while analyzing "Vault 7" dump ‚Äî thousands of documents and files leaked by Wikileaks, claiming to detail hacking tools and tactics of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

As previously reported, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-3881) resides in the Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) ‚Äî which uses Telnet or SSH to deliver signals and commands on internal networks ‚Äî in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software.

The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending "malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections," researchers say.

The company warned users on April 10 that an exploit targeting the flaw had been made public (here's a¬†proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit) and provided some mitigation advice, but patched the issue this week only.

Once exploited, an unauthenticated, remote attacker can remotely execute malicious code on a device with elevated privileges to take full control of the device or cause a reboot of the affected device.

The vulnerability is in the default configuration of the affected Cisco devices and affects 264 Catalyst switches, 51 industrial Ethernet switches, and 3 other devices if they are running IOS and are configured to accept Telnet connections.

The affected Cisco switch models include Catalyst switches, Embedded Service 2020 switches, IE Industrial Ethernet switches, ME 4924-10GE switch, Enhanced Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module, Enhanced Layer 2 EtherSwitch Service Module, RF Gateway 10, SM-X Layer 2/3 EtherSwitch Service Module, and Gigabit Ethernet Switch Module for HP (check the list of affected models¬†here).

The vulnerability was given a score of 9.8 (higher level of risk) based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, which means the issue is truly bad.

The only mitigation available for users was to disable the Telnet connection to the switch devices in favor of SSH, but now since the company has patched the issue, administrators are strongly advised to install the patch as soon as possible.

Researchers have uncovered a Chinese cyber-espionage against the United States ahead of the trade summit on Thursday between US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping.

According to a new report published today by Fidelis Cybersecurity firm, the Chinese APT10 hacking group implanted a piece of malware on the "Events" page of the US National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) website in February.

Dubbed 'Operation TradeSecret,' the attack against the NFTC site is seen as an attempt to conduct surveillance on the main industry players and lobbyists closely associated with U.S trade policy activities. 

Researchers say hackers placed a malicious link on the NFTC website, inviting the organization's board of directors to register for a meeting in Washington DC on March 7. But clicking on the link deployed a spying tool called "Scanbox."

Dates back to 2014, Scanbox ‚Äì previously used by nation-state threat actors associated with the Chinese government ‚Äì has the ability to record the type and versions of software a victim is running and run keyloggers on compromised computers, said Fidelis researcher John Bambenek.

"This attack was really at its core a reconnaissance attack. Anyone who visited this calendar entry would expose their software versions and use a JavaScript keylogger that could expose their identity," said Bambenek.

"Traditionally these attacks are used to precisely identify targets and help them craft targeted phishing attacks using exploits they know the victim is vulnerable to."
The malicious link was active on the NFTC website between February 27 and March 1. The malware was already removed from the site by the time Fidelis contacted NFTC.

The NFTC's staff and board represent many influential people and companies -- from President Rufus Yerxa, the U.S. Ambassador to GATT to executives from major companies including Google, Amazon, eBay, IBM, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Oracle,<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco,</span> KPMG, Pfizer, Visa, Ford, Halliburton, and Walmart.

Although Fidelis detected no further attacks on NFTC board members, the security firm believed the hackers were after a full range of entities relevant to the trade negotiations due to take place Thursday between US and China.

This is the second time in a week when APT10 cyber espionage campaign has come to light. A report released this week by BAE Systems, and PwC also claimed that APT10 was targeting managed IT services providers (MSPs) and their customers across the globe to steal sensitive data.

A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for a critical vulnerability in the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) has been publically released that could allow anyone to crash a server with just a single maliciously crafted packet.

The vulnerability has been patched by the Network Time Foundation with the release of NTP 4.2.8p9, which includes a total of 40 security patches, bug fixes, and improvements.

The NTP daemon is used in almost every device that needs to synchronize time on computer clocks. NTP got the most attention in late 2014 and 2015 when hackers used it to launch highly amplified DDoS attacks against services.

The flaw which affects NTP.org's nptd versions prior to 4.2.8p9, but not including ntp-4.3.94, has been discovered by security researcher Magnus Stubman, who privately disclosed it to the Network Time Foundation on June 24.

A patch for the vulnerability was developed and sent to Stubman on 29th September and just two days later, the researcher acknowledged that it mitigated the issue. And now he went with the public disclosure.

"The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to crash ntpd with a single malformed UDP packet, which causes a null pointer dereference," Stubman wrote in an advisory published Monday.
Stubman also released a PoC exploit that can crash the NTP daemon and creates a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The issue only affects Windows.

Besides Stubman's high severity vulnerability, the latest NTP update also addresses two medium severity bugs, two medium-low severity, and five low-severity security issues; 28 bug fixes, and contains other improvements over 4.2.8p8.

Another major bug is a trap-crash vulnerability reported by<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco'</span>s Matthew Van Gundy.

"If trap service has been explicitly enabled, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service," reads the advisory.
CERT at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University has also released the full list of the vulnerabilities in NTP and fixes. It also listed some vendors that implement NTP and could be affected by the bugs.

Since the exploit for the severe bug is available to the public, administrators are strongly recommended to patch their NTP implementations as soon as possible.

In the past, we have seen hackers abusing the NTP servers by sending small spoofed UDP packets to the vulnerable server that requests a significant amount of data (megabytes worth of traffic) to be sent to the DDoS's target IP Address.

Above 400 Gbps NTP amplification¬†DDoS Attack was carried out against content-delivery and anti-DDoS protection firm CloudFlare, and volumetric DDoS attacks exceeding 100 Gbps against popular Gaming services, including League of Legends, EA.com, and Battle.net from Blizzard in 2014.

In a study conducted by Arbor Networks in late 2013, the researchers illustrated the effectiveness of NTP amplification attacks that are massive and efficient to take any large server offline because they reflect 1,000 times the size of the initial query back to the target.

If you are a hacker, you might have enjoyed the NSA's private zero-day exploits, malware and hacking tools that were leaked last month.

But the question is: How these hacking tools ended up into the hands of hackers?

It has been found that the NSA itself was not directly hacked, but a former NSA employee carelessly left those hacking tools on a remote server three years ago after an operation and a group of Russian hackers found them, sources close to the investigation told Reuters.

The leaked hacking tools, which enable hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in systems from big vendors like<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>Systems, Juniper, and Fortinet, were dumped publicly online by the group calling itself "The Shadow Brokers."

NSA officials have also admitted to the FBI that their careless employee acknowledged the error shortly afterward, and hence the agency was aware of its operative's mistake from last three years.

But instead of warning the affected companies that their customers were at risk, the NSA maintained the silence.

"After the discovery, the NSA tuned its sensors to detect [the] use of any of the tools by other parties, especially foreign adversaries with strong cyber espionage operations, such as China and Russia," Reuters reports.
Well, that's Bullshit! If they call it a 'tactic.'

Shortly after the public release of NSA cyber weapons, firewall vendors Cisco and Fortinet confirmed that the leaked zero-day vulnerabilities were legitimate and issued out patches to fix those exploits.

We are still waiting for the comments from the NSA, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence about the matter.

Since the initial leak of NSA's hacking tools last month and confirmation of the leaked vulnerabilities being legitimate by Cisco and Fortinet, the intelligence agency and online community has been finding out the working exploits in the data dump that are still unknown and used in the wild.

Just recently, Cisco revealed a new zero-day vulnerability from the leaked data dump that had been used by hackers to target some of its customers, which indicates that hackers would likely continue to take advantage of the now-exposed exploits to conduct cyber attacks.

Network equipment vendor<span class="highlight-match"> Cisco </span>is finally warning its customers of another zero-day vulnerability the company discovered in the trove of NSA's hacking exploits and implants leaked by the group calling itself "The Shadow Brokers."

Last month, the Shadow Brokers published firewall exploits, implants, and hacking tools allegedly stolen from the NSA's Equation Group, which was designed to target major vendors including, Cisco, Juniper, and Fortinet.

A hacking exploit, dubbed ExtraBacon, leveraged a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2016-6366) resided in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco ASA software that could allow remote attackers to cause a reload of the affected system or execute malicious code.

Now Cisco has found another zero-day exploit, dubbed "Benigncertain," which targets PIX firewalls.

Cisco analyzed the exploit and noted that it had not identified any new flaws related to this exploit in its current products.

But, further analysis of Benigncertain revealed that the exploit also affects Cisco products running IOS, IOS XE and IOS XR software.

Benigncertain leveraged the vulnerability (CVE-2016-6415) that resides in the IKEv1 packet processing code and affects several Cisco devices running IOS operating system and all Cisco PIX firewalls.

IKE (Internet Key Exchange) is a protocol used for firewalls, to provide virtual private networks (VPNs), and even manage industrial control systems.

A remote, unauthorized attacker could use this vulnerability to retrieve memory contents from traffic and disclose critical information such as RSA private keys and configuration information by sending specially crafted IKEv1 packets to affected devices.

"The vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks in the part of the code that handles IKEv1 security negotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKEv1 packet to an affected device configured to accept IKEv1 security negotiation requests," Cisco said in its advisory.

Cisco's IOS operating system XR versions 4.3.x, 5.0.x, 5.1.x and 5.2.x, as well as PIX firewalls versions 6.x and earlier, are vulnerable to this flaw, though the company has not supported PIX since 2009.

Neither Cisco has developed a patch for the flaw, nor any workarounds are available.

The company said the vulnerability is currently under exploit, advising its customers to employ intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to help stop the attacks.

Cisco promised to release software updates to patch CVE-2016-6415 but did not specify a time frame.

	      Yahoo Disables Email Auto-Forwarding; Making It Harder for Users to Move On [0.92 Points on average]

Yahoo! has disabled automatic email forwarding -- a feature that lets its users forward a copy of incoming emails from one account to another.

The company has faced lots of bad news regarding its email service in past few weeks. Last month, the company admitted a massive 2014 data breach that exposed account details of over 500 Million Yahoo users.

If this wasn't enough for users to quit the service, another shocking revelation came last week that the company scanned the emails of hundreds of millions of its users at the request of a U.S. intelligence service last year.

That's enough for making a loyal Yahoo Mail user to switch for other rival alternatives, like Google Gmail, or Microsoft's Outlook.


Yahoo Mail Disables Auto-Forwarding; Making It Hard to Leave

But as Yahoo Mail users are trying to leave the email service, the company is making it more difficult for them to transition to another email service.

That's because since the beginning of October, the company has disabled Yahoo Mail's automatic email forwarding feature that would allow users to automatically redirect incoming emails from their Yahoo account to another account, reported by the Associated Press.

All of a sudden it's under development? Here's what a post on the company's help page reads about the feature's status:


"This feature is under development. While we work to improve it, we've temporarily disabled the ability to turn on Mail Forwarding for new forwarding addresses. If you've already enabled Mail Forwarding in the past, your email will continue to forward to the address you previously configured."

In other words, only users who already had the feature turned ON in the past are out of this trouble, but users who are trying to turn ON automatic email forwarding now have no option.

Yahoo has shared the following statement about the recent move:


"We're working to get auto-forward back up and running as soon as possible because we know how useful it can be to our users. The feature was temporary disabled as part of previously planned maintenance to improve its functionality between a user‚Äôs various accounts. Users can expect an update to the auto-forward functionality soon. In the meantime, we continue to support multiple account management."


Yahoo is trying to save its<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>Acquisition Deal

The move to turn off the email forwarding option could be an attempt to keep its customers‚Äô accounts active because any damage to the company at this time is crucial when Yahoo seeks to sell itself to Verizon.

The Yahoo acquisition deal has not yet closed, and Verizon Communications has reportedly asked for a $1 Billion discount off of Yahoo's $4.83 Billion sales price.

As a workaround, you could switch on your vacation responder instead to automatically reply to emails with a note about your new email address.


Delete Your Yahoo Account Before It's Too Late

You can also forego the forwarding process and simply delete your Yahoo Mail account entirely, until and unless Yahoo disables that option, too.

As the Reg media reports that British Telecoms customers, whose email had been outsourced to Yahoo, have not been able to set up automatic email forwarding or even access the option to delete their accounts.

"Sorry, the delete feature is currently unavailable. This feature will become available by the end of September," the error message reads.
So, hurry up before it gets too late.

Data Privacy is a serious concern today with the vast availability of personal data over the Internet ‚Äì a digital universe where websites collect your personal information and sell them to advertisers for dollars, and where hackers can easily steal your data from the ill-equipped.

If this wasn't enough, US Senate voted last week to eliminate privacy rules that would have forced ISPs to get your permission before selling your Web browsing history and app usage history to advertisers.

If passed, ISPs like<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon,</span> Comcast, and AT&T, can collect and sell data on what you buy, where you browse, and what you search, to advertisers all without taking your consent in order to earn more bucks.

How to Prevent ISPs And Hackers From Spying On You
So, how do you keep your data away from advertisers as well as hackers?

Private Browsing!

If you're worried about identity thieves or ISPs spying on or throttling your traffic, the most efficient way to secure your privacy on the Internet is to avoid mucking around in public networks; use a VPN instead.

But what is a VPN and how does the service enhance privacy and security?

VPN ‚Äì stands for Virtual Private Network ‚Äì is a secure tunnel between your computer and destinations you visit on the internet. Your computer connects to a VPN server, which can be located anywhere in the world, and your web traffic then passes back-&-forth through that server.

The Result: You are browsing from that server's geo-location, not your computer's location. So your identity remains anonymous.

To ensure the privacy of your data, VPN encrypts your data. Some VPNs use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) for encryption, while others might use IPSec or PPTP to keep your information encrypted from prying eyes.

Isn't it the great reason to use a VPN? Of course, Yes.

Since there are so many services to choose from, THN Deals Store brings you some excellent and secure VPN services at highly discounted prices with lifetime subscription, so it cannot get heavy in your pockets.

In what believe to be the largest data breach in history, Yahoo is reporting a massive data breach that disclosed personal details associated with more than 1 Billion user accounts in August 2013.

‚Ä¶And it's separate from the one disclosed by Yahoo! in September, in which hackers compromised as many as 500 Million user accounts in late 2014.

What's troubling is that the company has not been able to discovered how "an unauthorized third party" were able to steal the data associated with more than one Billion users.

The data breach officially disclosed on Wednesday actually occurred in 2013 and, just like the one in 2014, allowed the cyber crooks to obtain personal information of its users but not credit card details.

Here's what Yahoo's chief information security officer Bob Lord says the hackers obtained:

"The stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers."
The hashed passwords used an aging algorithm called MD5 that can easily be cracked. Moreover, in some incidents, the hack revealed unencrypted security questions and answers that would provide quick access to users accounts.

The public disclosure of this latest data breach came upon "further analysis" of data that law enforcement provided Yahoo in November.


Change your Password and Security Q&A Immediately

Of course, if you are one of those potentially affected users, you are strongly recommended to change your passwords and invalidate affected security questions.

Also, if you are using the same password and answers for security questions somewhere else, change them too.

Yahoo has started notifying the account holders affected by the massive data breach, requiring them to change their passwords immediately.

Both the data breaches at Yahoo! came after the company negotiated a deal to sell its core internet business to<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>Communication Inc for $4.8 Billion.

The September disclosure of half a billion users' breach prompted Verizon to say in October that it might withdraw from the agreement to buy Yahoo.

Here's the statement from Verizon spokesman Bob Verettoni about the recent largest data breach:

"As we've said all along, we will evaluate the situation as Yahoo continues its investigation. We will review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions."
Previous data breach news had already magnified company's problems, and now when another data breach affecting a Billion users has been disclosed, would Yahoo be able to save its acquisition deal?

Bad News for privacy concerned people!

It will be once again easier for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to sell your personal data for marketing or advertisement purposes without taking your permission.

Last October, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) passed a set of privacy rules on ISPs that restrict them from sharing your online data with third parties without your consent and require them to adopt "reasonable measures" to protect consumers' data from hackers.

However, now the FCC suspended privacy rules before they came into effect.

The reason? President Donald Trump's newly appointed FCC chairman Ajit Pai, a Republican and ex-Verizon lawyer.

Ajit Pai, who has openly expressed his views against net neutrality in the past, just last week said during a speech at Mobile World Congress that Net Neutrality was "a mistake" and indicated that the Commission is now moving back to internet regulations.

Now, Pai suspends privacy rules on ISPs, arguing that they favored companies like Google and Facebook, which are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), over internet providers like Comcast and<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon.</span>

Pai wants the FCC, and the Federal Trade Commission should treat all online entities the same way. So those new privacy policies should be scrapped.

"All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, and the federal government shouldn‚Äôt favor one set of companies over another," FCC said in a statement.

"Therefore, he has advocated returning to a technology-neutral privacy framework for the online world and harmonizing the FCC‚Äôs privacy rules for broadband providers with the FTC‚Äôs standards for others in the digital economy."
The FCC will now likely pass a new set of standards in the way the FTC regulates websites. It's like, if the FTC requires sites like Facebook and Google to seek explicit permission before selling your data, the FCC may follow suit for ISPs.

In other words, the FCC will keep a hold on new privacy rules. Since FTC would never hurt advertising business model of Google and Facebook, FCC would never restore those suspended rules on ISPs.


How does this Move Affect You?

If you are unaware, your internet service provider knows your most intimate and personal online activities.

Unlike Google which uses encryption to prevent anyone from seeing your online searches, your ISP can see your search queries, what websites you visit, when you visit them, and what apps you use.

The ISPs then share this data with other companies for advertisements, marketing or other purposes. And with this information in hands, it's very easy for any advertising company to know users' interests based on their online behaviors and serve them targeted ads.

Not surprisingly, the broadband industry applauded the FCC's new move, calling it "a welcome recognition that consumers benefit most when privacy protections are consistently applied throughout the Internet ecosystem."
But privacy advocates are not at all happy with the FCC's action, arguing that suspending the privacy rules favor the Internet providers like Comcast and Verizon since the ISPs do not need the same data security rules the FTC requires of websites.

500 million accounts ‚Äî that's half a Billion users!

That's how many Yahoo accounts were compromised in a massive data breach dating back to 2014 by what was believed to be a "state sponsored" hacking group.

Over a month ago, a hacker was found to be selling login information related to 200 million Yahoo accounts on the Dark Web, although Yahoo acknowledged that the breach was much worse than initially expected.

"A recent investigation by Yahoo! Inc. has confirmed that a copy of certain user account information was stolen from the company's network in late 2014 by what it believes is a state-sponsored actor," reads the statement.
Yahoo is investigating the breach with law enforcement agency and currently believes that users' names, email addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, passwords, and in some cases, encrypted and unencrypted security questions-answers were stolen from millions of Yahoo users.

However, the company does not believe the stolen information includes credit card information or any bank details of the affected users.

Yahoo has been criticized for its slow response to the data breach, but it is now in the process of notifying affected customers via emails and asking them to change their passwords, as well as security questions.

At this moment Yahoo did not provide any evidence on why it believed the breach was work of state-sponsored hackers.

Despite millions of people affected by the breach, the biggest victim here seems to be Yahoo itself.

The data breach reports come just as the company is trying to negotiate a deal to sell itself to<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>for $4.8 Billion. So, if the breach reports negatively impact its share price, even for the time being, it could cost the company and its shareholders a slice of its buyout value.

Over past few months, a large number of data breaches have been reported to plague companies like LinkedIn, MySpace, Tumblr, and VK.com as hackers put up for sale massive data dumps of user credentials stolen earlier in the decade.

Change your Password and Use Password Manager
Needless to say, users should immediately change their Yahoo account password. The company will also be prompting anyone who hasn't changed their password since 2014 to do so now.
"Additionally, Yahoo asks users to consider using Yahoo Account Key, a simple authentication tool that eliminates the need to use a password altogether," Yahoo suggests.Also make sure that you also change your passwords on other online accounts if they use the same password, and enable two-factor authentication for online accounts immediately.

And once again, a strong recommendation: Don't reuse passwords.

If you are unable to remember different passwords for each site, you can adopt a good password manager that allows you to create complex passwords for various sites as well as remember them for you.

We have recently listed some best password managers that could help you understand the importance of password managers and help you choose a suitable one, according to your requirement.

Viacom‚Äîthe popular entertainment and media company that owns Paramount Pictures, Comedy Central, MTV, and hundreds of other properties‚Äîhas exposed the keys to its kingdom on an unsecured Amazon S3 server.

A security researcher working for California-based cyber resiliency firm UpGuard has recently discovered a wide-open, public-facing misconfigured Amazon Web Server S3 cloud storage bucket containing roughly a gigabyte's worth of credentials and configuration files for the backend of dozens of Viacom properties.

These exposed credentials discovered by UpGuard researcher Chris Vickery would have been enough for hackers to take down Viacom's internal IT infrastructure and internet presence, allowing them to access cloud servers belonging to MTV, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon.

Among the data exposed in the leak was Viacom's master key to its Amazon Web Services account, and the credentials required to build and maintain Viacom servers across its many subsidiaries and dozens of brands.

"Perhaps most damaging among the exposed data are Viacom's secret cloud keys, an exposure that, in the most damaging circumstances, could put the international media conglomerate's cloud-based servers in the hands of hackers," an UpGuard blog post says.¬†

"Such a scenario could enable malicious actors to launch a host of damaging attacks, using the IT infrastructure of one of the world's largest broadcast and media companies."
In other words, the access key and secret key for the company's AWS account would have allowed hackers to compromise Viacom's servers, storage, and databases under the AWS account.


According to the analysis performed by UpGuard, a number of cloud instances used within the media company's IT toolchain, including Docker, Splunk, New Relic, and Jenkins, could have "thus been compromised in this manner."

In addition to these damaging leaks, the unprotected server also contained GPG decryption keys, which can be used to unlock sensitive data. However, the server did not contain any customer or employee information.

Although it is unclear whether hackers were able to exploit this information to access important files belonging to Viacom and the firms it owns, the media giant said there's no evidence anyone had abused its data.

"We have analyzed the data in question and determined there was no material impact," the company said in a statement.

"Once Viacom became aware that information on a server‚Äîincluding technical information, but no employee or customer information‚Äîwas publicly accessible, we rectified the issue."
All the credentials have now been changed after UpGuard contacted Viacom executives privately, and the server was secured shortly afterwards.

This is not the first time when Vickery has discovered a company's sensitive information stored on an unprotected AWS C3 server.

Vickery has previously tracked down many exposed datasets on the Internet, including personal details of over¬†14 million<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>customers, a cache of 60,000 documents from a US military, information of over 191 Million US voter records, and 13 Million MacKeeper users.

The 2014 Yahoo hack disclosed late last year that compromised over 500 million Yahoo user accounts was believed to be carried out by a state-sponsored hacking group.

Now, two Russian intelligence officers and two criminal hackers have been charged by the US government in connection with the 2014 Yahoo hack that compromised about 500 million Yahoo user accounts, the Department of Justice announced Wednesday.

According to the prosecutors, at least 30 million accounts were accessed as part of a spam campaign to access the email contents of thousands of people, including journalists, government officials, and technology company employees.

The four defendants ‚Äî Two officers from the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and two other hackers ‚Äî are identified as:


Dmitry Aleksandrovich Dokuchaev, 33 ‚Äî an officer in the FSB Center for Information Security at the time of the hack, and now Russian national and resident.
Igor Anatolyevich Sushchin, 43 ‚Äî an FSB officer, a superior to Dokuchaev within the FSB, and Russian national and resident.
Alexsey Alexseyevich Belan, aka "Magg," 29 ‚Äî a Russian national and resident, who has been on the FBI‚Äôs Most Wanted Hackers list and indicted twice in 2012 and 2013 by U.S. Federal grand juries for hacking and fraud charges.
Karim Baratov, aka "Kay," "Karim Taloverov" and "Karim Akehmet Tokbergenov," 22 ‚Äî a Canadian and Kazakh national and a resident of Canada.


In a 38-page indictment [PDF] unsealed Wednesday, the prosecutors said the two Russian spies worked with two other hackers to break into and gained initial access to Yahoo in early 2014.

Belan, who is on the FBI's most-wanted cybercriminals list, used the file transfer protocol (FTP) to download the Yahoo database, containing usernames, recovery e-mail accounts, phone numbers as well as "certain information required to manually create, or "mint," account authentication web browser ‚Äúcookies‚Äù for more than 500 million Yahoo accounts."

The spies then used the stolen information to obtain unauthorized access to the contents of accounts at Yahoo, Google and other webmail providers, including those of Russian and American officials, Russian journalists, employees of financial services and other businesses.

The range of charges are officially listed as:


Conspiring to commit computer fraud and abuse
Conspiring to engage in and the theft of trade secrets
Conspiring to engage in and committing economic espionage
Conspiring to commit wire fraud
Counterfeit access device fraud
Counterfeit access device making equipment
Aggravated identity theft
Transmitting code with the intent to cause damage to computers
Unauthorized access to a computer for obtaining information for commercial advantage and private financial gain


Baratov was arrested on Tuesday by the Toronto Police Department, while Belan and the two FSB officers are in Russia. The United States has requested all the three to be handed over to face charges, but the US has no extradition treaty with Russia.

Meanwhile, Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord said that there was no connection between the Wednesday indictment and the investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) last year.

The news of the arrest came few weeks after Yahoo and<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>Communications Inc. agreed to reduce the price of the upcoming acquisition deal by $350 Million in the wake of the two data breaches.

The deal, which was previously finalized at $4.8 Billion, now valued at about $4.48 Billion in cash and is expected to close in the second quarter.

If the death of online privacy rules wasn't enough for Internet Service Providers and advertisers to celebrate,<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>has planned to pre-install spyware on customers' Android devices in order to collect their personal data.

The telecom giant has partnered with Evie Launcher to bring a new application called 'AppFlash' ‚Äî a universal search bar that will come pre-installed on the home screens of all Verizon Android handsets for quickly finding apps and web content.

AppFlash is simply a Google search bar replacement, but instead of collecting and sending telemetry data including what you search, handset, apps and other online activities to Google, it will send to Verizon.

What's worse? Just like other pre-installed bloatware apps, Android users can't uninstall AppFlash quickly, unless they have rooted their phone.

AppFlash allows you to search inside apps or browse through listings of nearby restaurants and entertainment. The built-in Google Search can also do all these stuff. So, there's nothing this app does that a Google search can‚Äôt.

Then what's the need for this app? Of course, selling your data to advertisers or other big data companies and make money ‚Äî thanks to the US Senate that allowed ISPs to collect and sell your data without permission and banned the FCC from ever passing any rule that would limit these powers.

Here's what the privacy policy of AppFlash reads:


We collect information about your device and your use of the AppFlash services. This information includes your mobile number, device identifiers, device type and operating system, and information about the AppFlash features and services you use and your interactions with them.¬†


We also access information about the list of apps you have on your device. With your permission, AppFlash also collects information about your device‚Äôs precise location from your device operating system as well as contact information you store on your device.¬†


AppFlash information may be shared within the Verizon family of companies, including companies like AOL who may use it to help provide more relevant advertising within the AppFlash experiences and in other places, including non-Verizon sites, services, and devices.

What's more? There is a 'Suggested Apps' section on the AppFlash main screen, which means that those apps have paid Verizon a good price to list on the main screen.


How to Get Rid of ‚ÄòAppFlash‚Äô on Your Verizon Android Phone

Users can get rid of this bloatware in two ways: you can either root your device and remove the app in question, or only disable the app.

1. Root to remove AppFlash¬†from Android: Since the company has made AppFlash a default app on the home screen of its Android handsets to help users search content and browse the internet, the app can not be uninstalled.

So, in order to uninstall AppFlash, you are required to root your Android device and then delete the app from your storage memory.

 2. Disable AppFlash¬†without Root: Since rooting is a dangerous process that void your device warranty, you can simply disable AppFlash.

Disabling bloatware apps on newer phones is easy, as Android has a built-in way to do this, which doesn't require any root access.

Just head on to Settings ‚Üí Apps (or 'Applications' on some phones) ‚Üí AppFlash. Now open it and click 'Disable,' 'Force Stop' and then 'Clear Data' as well.

The massive data breach that Yahoo! confirmed to the world last week is claimed by the company to have been carried out by a "state-sponsored actor" in 2014, which exposed the accounts of at least 500 Million Yahoo users.

But, now it seems that Yahoo has downplayed a mega data breach and trying to hide it's own security blunder.

Recently the information security firm InfoArmor that analyzed the data breach refuted the Yahoo's claim, stating that the data breach was the work of seasoned cyber criminals who later sold the compromised Yahoo accounts to an Eastern European nation-state.


Over 1 Billion Accounts May Have Been Hacked

Now, there's one more twist in the unprecedented data heist.

A recent advancement in the report indicates that the number of affected Yahoo accounts may be between 1 Billion and 3 Billion.

An unnamed, former Yahoo executive who is familiar with the company's security says that the Yahoo's back-end system's architecture is designed in such a way that all of its products use one main user database (UDB) to authenticate users, Business Insider reported Friday.

So all usernames and passwords that users enter to log into services like Yahoo Mail, Sports or Finance goes to this one central database to ensure they are valid, allowing them access.

This central database is what got compromised, and therefore, it's quite difficult to believe that the hackers who compromised the whole database walk away with just a small bunch of "the core crown jewels of Yahoo customer credentials."

Whoever carried out the hack not only stole usernames and email addresses of affected users but also pilfered other personal information, including their dates of birth, phone numbers, hashed passwords, and unencrypted security answers.

So, it's unclear how Yahoo come up with the 500 Million number.

The company had not commented further on how the data breach happened or when it was discovered, citing an active investigation.


Yahoo! could have saved you, but decided not to:

A lengthy report published by the New York Times seemingly explains that the company did not reset the passwords of its users after the breach due to the decisions made by Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer, who seemed to prioritize developing new products over making security improvements.

The reason sounds stupid, as the article reads:

"The 'Paranoids,' the internal name for Yahoo's security team, often clashed with other parts of the business over security costs. And their requests were often overridden because of concerns that the inconvenience of added protection would make people stop using the company's products."
If Yahoo had reset the passwords of its affected users, proper security measures would have been taken by users to protect their personal data from hackers.

Let's see what new advancements come to this unprecedented data breach.

Already, the Yahoo hack is believed to be one of the biggest in history, and the company is still trying to negotiate a deal to sell its core business to<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>for $4.8 Billion.

Yahoo! has yet to respond to the recent revelation by the insider.

Data breach news has already magnified company's problems, but if breach number reaches Billion, would the company be able to save its acquisition deal?

Yahoo has just revealed that around 32 million user accounts were accessed by hackers in the last two years using a sophisticated cookie forging attack without any password.

These compromised accounts are in addition to the Yahoo accounts affected by the two massive data breaches that the company disclosed in last few months.

The former tech giant said that in a regulatory filing Wednesday that the cookie caper is likely linked to the "same state-sponsored actor" thought to be behind a separate, 2014 data breach that resulted in the theft of 500 Million user accounts.


"Based on the investigation, we believe an unauthorized third party accessed the company's proprietary code to learn how to forge certain cookies," Yahoo said in its annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

"The outside forensic experts have identified approximately 32 million user accounts for which they believe forged cookies were used or taken in 2015 and 2016. We believe that some of this activity is connected to the same state-sponsored actor believed to be responsible for the 2014 security incident."
"Forged cookies" are digital keys that allow access to accounts without re-entering passwords.

Instead of stealing passwords, hackers trick a web browser into telling Yahoo that the victim had already logged in by forging little web browser tokens called cookies.



Yahoo revealed the cookie caper in December last year, but the news was largely overlooked, as the statement from Yahoo provided information on a separate data breach that occurred in August 2013 involving more than 1 Billion Yahoo accounts.

In a statement, the company said the hackers might have stolen names, email addresses, hashed passwords, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.

Yahoo began warning its customers just last month that some state-sponsored actors had accessed their Yahoo accounts by using the sophisticated cookie forging attack.

However, the good news is that the forged cookies have since been "invalidated" by Yahoo so they cannot be used to access user accounts.


Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer Loses Bonus

In the meantime when Yahoo revealed about the scope of the cookie caper, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said she would forgo her annual bonus, which is US$2 Million, and any 2017 equity award, which is usually about $12 Million of stock, in response to the security incidents occurred during her tenure.

"When I learned in September 2016 that a large number of our user database files had been stolen, I worked with the team to disclose the incident to users, regulators, and government agencies," Mayer wrote in a note published Monday on Tumblr.

"However, I am the CEO of the company and since this incident happened during my tenure, I have agreed to forgo my annual bonus and my annual equity grant this year and have expressed my desire that my bonus be redistributed to our company‚Äôs hardworking employees, who contributed so much to Yahoo‚Äôs success in 2016."
Besides this, Yahoo's general counsel and secretary Ronald Bell also resigned as of Wednesday after the company revealed that "senior executives and relevant legal staff were aware that a state-sponsored actor had accessed certain user accounts by exploiting the Company‚Äôs account management tool."

The ongoing revelation of security incidents in the company has hit Yahoo's credibility badly. Just last month, Yahoo and<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>Communications Inc. agreed to reduce the price of the upcoming acquisition deal by $350 Million in the wake of the two data breaches.

The deal, which was previously finalized at $4.8 Billion, now valued at about $4.48 Billion in cash and is expected to close in the second quarter.

Security researchers have been warning for years about critical security holes in the Signaling System 7 (SS7) that could allow hackers to listen in private phone calls and read text messages on a potentially vast scale, despite the most advanced encryption used by cellular networks.

Cellular networks, on the other hand, have consistently been ignoring this serious issue, saying that it is a very low risk for most people, as the exploitation of the SS7 flaws requires significant technical and financial investment.

But some unknown hackers have just proved them wrong by recently exploiting the design flaws in the SS7 to drain victims' bank accounts, according to a report published  Wednesday by German-based newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung.

SS7 is a telephony signaling protocol created in the 1980s by telcos and powered more than 800 telecom operators across the world, including AT&T and<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon,</span> to interconnect and exchange data, like routing calls and texts with one another, enabling roaming, and other services. 


Real-World SS7 Attack Scenarios

The global telecom network SS7 is vulnerable to several design flaws that could allow hackers to listen to phone calls and intercept text messages on a potentially massive scale, despite the most advanced encryption used by cellular network operators.

The designing flaws in SS7 have been in circulation since 2014 when a team of researchers at German Security Research Labs alerted the world to it.

So, the privacy concerns regarding the SS7 protocol is not new.


Here's the real-world evidence that cyber-criminals are using long-known SS7 vulnerability to drain Bank accounts.

CLICK TO TWEET


Last year, Karsten Nohl of German Security Research Labs demonstrated the SS7 attack on US Congressman Ted Lieu's phone number (with his permission) at TV program 60 Minutes and successfully intercepted his iPhone, recorded call, and tracked his precise location in real-time just by using his cell phone number and access to an SS7 network.

In a separate demonstration, the researchers from Positive Technologies last year also gave a demonstration on the WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook hacks using the same designing flaws in SS7 to bypass two-factor authentication used by the services.


Thieves Using SS7 Flaw to Steal Money From Bank Accounts

Now, Germany's O2 Telefonica has confirmed that the same SS7 weaknesses have recently been exploited by cybercriminals to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) banks used to prevent unauthorized withdrawals from users bank accounts.

"Criminals carried out an attack from a network of a foreign mobile network operator in the middle of January," an O2 Telefonica representative told S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. "The attack redirected incoming SMS messages for selected German customers to the attackers."

In short, cyber criminals exploited SS7 flaws to intercept two-factor authentication codes (one-time passcode, or OTP) sent to online banking customers and drained their bank accounts.


Here's How: 

The attackers first spammed out traditional bank-fraud trojans to infect account holders' computers and steal passwords used to log into bank accounts, view accounts balance, along with their mobile number.

But what prevented the attackers from making money transfers is the one-time password the bank sent via a text message to its online banking customers in order to authorize the transfer of funds between accounts.

To overcome this issue, the cyber crooks then purchased the access to a fake telecom provider and set-up a redirect for the victim's phone number to a handset controlled by them. Specifically, they used SS7 to redirect the SMSes containing OTPs sent by the bank. 

Next, the attackers logged into victims' online bank accounts and transferred money out, because as soon as the authorization codes were sent by the bank, instead of designated account holders, they were routed to numbers controlled by the attackers, who finalized the transaction.


Can You Avoid this Hack?

This latest SS7 attack once again shed light on the insecurity by design and lack of privacy in the global telephone network protocol, making it clear that real-world SS7 attacks are possible. And since the SS7 network is used worldwide, the issue puts billions of users in danger.

The incident also underscores the risks of relying on SMS-based two-factor authentication. 

Although the network operators are unable to patch the hole anytime soon, there is little the smartphone users can do. Avoid using two-factor authentication via SMS texts for receiving OTP codes. Instead, rely on cryptographically-based security keys as a second authentication factor.

<span class="highlight-match">
Verizon,</span> the major telecommunications provider, has suffered a data security breach with over 14 million US customers' personal details exposed on the Internet after NICE Systems, a third-party vendor, mistakenly left the sensitive users‚Äô details open on a server.

Chris Vickery, researcher and director of cyber risk research at security firm UpGuard, discovered the exposed data on an unprotected Amazon S3 cloud server that was fully downloadable and configured to allow public access.

The exposed data includes sensitive information of millions of customers, including their names, phone numbers, and account PINs (personal identification numbers), which is enough for anyone to access an individual's account, even if the account is protected by two-factor authentication.

"The exposure of Verizon account PIN codes used to verify customers, listed alongside their associated phone numbers, is particularly concerning," explained UpGuard's Dan O'Sullivan in a blog post.
NICE Systems is an Israel-based company that is known for offering wide-range of solutions for intelligence agencies, including telephone voice recording, data security, and surveillance.


According to the researcher, it is unknown that why Verizon has allowed a 3rd party company to collect call details of its users, however, it appears that NICE Systems monitors the efficiency of its call-center operators for Verizon.

The exposed data contained records of customers who called the Verizon's customer services in the past 6 months, which are recorded, obtained and analyzed by NICE.

Interestingly, the leaked data on the server also indicates that NICE Systems has a partnership with Paris-based popular telecommunication company "Orange," for which it also collects customer details across Europe and Africa.

"Finally, this exposure is a potent example of the risks of third-party vendors handling sensitive data," O'Sullivan said.¬†

"NICE Systems' history of supplying technology for use in intrusive, state-sponsored surveillance is an unsettling indicator of the severity of this breach of privacy."
Vickery had privately informed Verizon team about the exposure in late June, and the data was then secured within a week.

Vickery is a reputed researcher, who has previously tracked down many exposed datasets on the Internet.

Just last month, he discovered an unsecured Amazon S3 server owned by data analytics firm Deep Root Analytics (DRA), which exposed information of more than 198 Million United States citizens, that's over 60% of the US population.

In March this year, Vickery discovered a cache of 60,000 documents from a US military project for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) which was also left unsecured on Amazon cloud storage server for anyone to access.

In the same month, the researcher also discovered an unsecured and publicly exposed database, containing nearly 1.4 Billion user records, linked to River City Media (RCM).

In 2015, Vickery also reported a huge cache of more than 191 Million US voter records and details of as many as 13 Million MacKeeper users.

It's time to say goodbye to Yahoo!

While Yahoo's core internet business was being sold to<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>for $4.8 Billion, the remaining portions of the company left behind is renaming itself to Altaba Inc, which marks the sad ending of one of the most familiar brand names on the internet.

In a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, the company announced that after the planned sale of its core business to telecom giant Verizon, the leftover would change its brand name to Altaba.

So, the company's branding you are familiar with will integrate with Verizon, and it is possible that the telecom titan may continue to use the Yahoo brand for some of the services that it will acquire in the deal.

The remaining company under the new name Altaba Inc. is hanging on to its 15% ownership of Alibaba and 35.5% stake in Yahoo Japan, which is a joint venture with Softbank.


Marissa Mayer to Leave Yahoo Board

The newly formed company will operate as an investment company, and only five board members will remain at the company including Tor Braham, Catherine Friedman, Eric Brandt, Jeffrey Smith and Thomas McInerney.

The rest of the company's board, including Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and co-founder David Filo, will step down from Altaba Inc. Mayer may be appointed for a role in Yahoo's integration at Verizon, though her position has yet to be announced.

Mayer's intention to resign from the new board is "not due to any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices," says the filing.

The Yahoo acquisition deal was rumored to be on the rocks after the company disclosed multiple security breaches a few months ago affecting more than 1 Billion users.

Moreover, over three months ago, Yahoo was also accused of building a secret backdoor in its system to scan the emails of hundreds of millions of its users at the request of a U.S. intelligence service.

After Verizon had learned about those disclosures about hacking and spying, it was expecting a discount in the Yahoo acquisition deal, which may still be announced before the deal closes.

Yahoo ‚Äî or, should we say Altaba now? ‚Äî noted "risks that Verizon may assert, or threaten to assert, rights or claims with respect to the Stock Purchase Agreement as a result of facts relating to the security incidents disclosed on September 22, 2016 and December 14, 2016 and may seek to terminate the Stock Purchase Agreement or renegotiate the terms of the Sale Transaction on that basis," reads its SEC filing.

End of the Famous Pioneer of the Early Internet Era


The saddest part of the whole saga is the end of one of Silicon Valley's most recognizable leaders.

Founded by Stanford graduates Jerry Yang and David Filo in 1994, Yahoo was once the king of the Internet, but it lost out to more innovative rivals including Google and Facebook.

Yahoo was once a $125 billion behemoth as big in its time as Facebook or Google are today, but Mayer's time at the company has been marred by slowing growth and internal dissent, which leads to the end of one of the pioneers of the early internet era.

Hardly a day goes without headlines about any significant data breach. In the past few months, over 1 Billion account credentials from popular social network sites, including LinkedIn, Tumblr, MySpace and VK.com were exposed on the Internet.

Now, the same hacker who was responsible for selling data dumps for LinkedIn, MySpace, Tumblr and VK.com is now selling what is said to be the login information of 200 Million Yahoo! users on the Dark Web.


200 Million Yahoo! Logins for 3 BTC

The hacker, who goes by the pseudonym "Peace" or "peace_of_mind," has uploaded 200 Million Yahoo! credentials up for sale on an underground marketplace called The Real Deal for 3 Bitcoins (US$1,824).

Yahoo! admitted the company was "aware" of the potential leak, but did not confirm the authenticity of the data.

The leaked database includes usernames, MD5-hashed passwords and date of births from 200 Million Yahoo! Users. In some cases, there is also the backup email addresses used for the account, country of origin, as well as the ZIP codes for United States users.


Easily Crackable Passwords

Since the passwords are MD5-encrypted, hackers could easily decrypt them using an MD5 decrypter available online, making Yahoo! users open to hackers.

In a brief description, Peace says the Yahoo! database "most likely" comes from 2012, the same year when Marissa Mayer became Yahoo's CEO.

Just last week,<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>acquired Yahoo! for $4.8 Billion. So, the hacker decided to monetize the stolen user accounts before the data lose its value.

When reached out, the company said in a statement:


"We are committed to protecting the security of our users' information and we take such claim very seriously. Our security team is working to determine the facts...we always encourage our users to create strong passwords, or give up passwords altogether by using Yahoo Account Key, and use different passwords for different platforms."


Use Password Managers to Secure Your Online Accounts

Although the company has not confirmed the breach, users are still advised to change their passwords (and keep a longer and stronger one using a good password manager) and enable two-factor authentication for online accounts immediately, especially if you are using the same password for multiple websites.

You can also adopt a good password manager that allows you to create complex passwords for different sites as well as remember them for you. 

We have listed some best password managers here that could help you understand the importance of password manager and help you choose a suitable one, according to your requirement.

It seems like it is not all over for Yahoo yet. Another day, another bad news for Yahoo!
<span class="highlight-match">
Verizon,</span> which has agreed to purchase¬†Yahoo for $4.8 Billion, is now asking for a $1 Billion discount, according to recent reports.

The request comes after Verizon Communications learned about the recent disclosures about hacking¬†and spying in past few weeks.

Just two weeks ago, Yahoo revealed that at least a half Billion Yahoo accounts were stolen in 2014 hack, marking it as the biggest data breach in history.

And if this wasn't enough, the company faced allegations earlier this week that it built a secret tool to scan¬†all of its users' emails last year at the behest of a United States intelligence agency.

Due to these incidents, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who runs the Verizon subsidiary, is "pretty upset" about Yahoo's lack of disclosure, and is even seeking to pull out of the deal completely or cut the price, the New York Post claimed,¬†citing multiple sources.

"In the last day, we've heard that Tim [Armstrong] is getting cold feet," a source reportedly told the Post. "He's pretty upset about the lack of disclosure, and he's saying can we get out of this or can we reduce the price?"Armstrong is reportedly discussing a price reduction with Yahoo executives, though Yahoo is pushing back, claiming a "deal is a deal" and there's no legal recourse to change the terms, according to the paper.

Both Verizon and Yahoo have yet to comment on the matter.

Verizon announced the Yahoo acquisition deal in July, with the intention of merging it with AOL. The company is thinking to combine Yahoo and AOL to form a third force to compete with Google and Facebook for digital advertising.

The acquisition deal is supposed to close early next year, merging Yahoo's search, advertising, content, and mobile operations with AOL to reach 1 Billion users.

	      Save the Internet: FCC Unveils Plan to Rollback Net-Neutrality Rules [1.07 Points on average]

After crushing a set of privacy rules on ISPs that restrict them from sharing your online data with third parties without your consent, President Donald Trump's newly appointed FCC chairman Ajit Pai has announced the first move in its efforts to kill off Net Neutrality.

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has announced that it will roll back net neutrality rules that require Internet service providers (ISPs) to treat all services and websites on the Internet equally.

Before moving forward, let‚Äôs first understand What does Net Neutrality mean?


What is Net Neutrality And Why It's Important?

Net Neutrality is simply the Internet Freedom ‚Äî Free, Fast and Open Internet for all.

Net Neutrality is the principle that ISPs should give consumers access to all and every contents and application on an equal basis, treating all Internet traffic equally.

Today, if there is something that makes everyone across the world ‚ÄòEqual,‚Äô it‚Äôs the Internet. 

Equality over the Internet means, all ISPs have to treat Facebook or Google in the same way as your local shop website, and the richest man in the world has the same rights to access the Internet as the poorer.

And this is what "Net Neutrality" aims at.


FCC Unveils Plans to Kill Net Neutrality

But, What if someone snatches this Internet Freedom from you all? What if you have to pay ISPs extra for loading your website faster? What if you can't access your favorite website, which has been blocked by your ISP?

The FCC's new Chairman Pai is planning to do exactly same in the United States.

In a 400 page document released Wednesday, the FCC detailed its new plan which, if passed, would allow ISPs to give or sell access to "fast lanes" and block web traffic to others.

In other words, the new plan will allow ISPs to block access to legal content, restrain connections for users attempting to access certain sites or services and to be paid for prioritizing some lawful web traffic over other lawful web traffic.

This simply means if for example, you love watching movies and TV series on Netflix, Comcast and<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon,</span> which have their video services, will slow down the connections to its competing service when you try to access it, and you would eventually end up watching videos at the services they want you to use.


Here‚Äôs What FCC Chairman Excused About Reversing Net Neutrality Rules:

"We need rules that focus on growth and infrastructure investment, rules that expand high-speed Internet access everywhere. Rules that give Americans a more online choice, faster speeds, and more innovation," Pai said.
Pai argued that the 2015 regulations in the Obama administration had discouraged ISPs from investing in their networks, as well as slowed the expansion of internet access.

Also, ISPs are much more likely to strike valuable deals with large, established websites and services than relatively unknown companies or startups, which will be hit hardest by this new move.

"Without net neutrality, the incumbents who provide access to the Internet would be able to pick winners or losers in the market," reads a letter sent to Pai by a group of 800 startups.

"They could impede traffic from our services in order to favor their own services or established competitors. Or they could impose new tolls on us, inhibiting consumer choice. Those actions directly impede an entrepreneur‚Äôs ability to ‚Äòstart a business, immediately reach a worldwide customer base, and disrupt an entire industry."
Meanwhile, with no surprise, ISPs including Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T have welcomed the new plans.

The FCC will vote on the rollback of the FCC's 2015 regulations on May 18 and proposed rule change, but Mr. Pai has not revealed what he wants to replace the net neutrality rules with.

Once approved, the proposal will remove any legal power the FCC currently has to regulate ISPs, returning everything to the state it was before 2015.

Pai, who has openly expressed his views against net neutrality in the past, was previously quoted as saying that Net Neutrality was "a mistake" during a speech at Mobile World Congress.

The non-profit foundation Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is encouraging people to take action before it gets too late and "tell Congress to stop the FCC from throwing Internet users and innovators to the wolves."

Has Yahoo rebuilt your trust again?

If yes, then you need to think once again, as the company is warning its users of another hack.

Last year, Yahoo admitted two of the largest data breaches on record. One of which that took place in 2013 disclosed personal details associated with more than 1 Billion Yahoo user accounts.

Well, it's happened yet again.

Yahoo sent out another round of notifications to its users on Wednesday, warning that their accounts may have been compromised as recently as last year after an ongoing investigation turned up evidence that hackers used forged cookies to log accounts without passwords.

The company quietly revealed the data breach in security update in December 2016, but the news was largely overlooked, as the statement from Yahoo provided information on a separate data breach that occurred in August 2013 involving more than 1 billion accounts.

The warning message sent Wednesday to some Yahoo users read:

"Based on the ongoing investigation, we believe a forged cookie may have been used in 2015 or 2016 to access your account."
The total number of customers affected by this attack is still unknown, though the company has confirmed that the accounts were affected by a security flaw in Yahoo's mail service.

The flaw allowed "state-sponsored attackers" to use a "forged cookie" created by software stolen from within the company's internal systems to gain access to Yahoo accounts without passwords.

"Forged cookies" are digital keys that allow access to accounts without re-entering passwords.


Here's how the attack works:

Instead of stealing passwords, hackers trick a web browser into telling the company that the victim had already logged in by forging little web browser tokens called cookies.

You use cookies every time you log into any service and check that box that says "keep me logged in," or, "remember me."

So, even if you close the window, or shutdown your system, you will not have to log back into your account because the cookie stored by your browser tells the online service that you already submitted your username and password.

Here's what a Yahoo spokesperson said about the recently disclosed breach:

"As we have previously disclosed, our outside forensic experts have been investigating the creation of forged cookies that could have enabled an intruder to access our users' accounts without a password."¬†

"The investigation has identified user accounts for which we believe forged cookies were taken or used. Yahoo is in the process of notifying all potentially affected account holders."
The warning notification has been sent out to almost all affected Yahoo users, although investigations are still ongoing.

The notice sent to Yahoo's customers on Wednesday, the same day it was reported that<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>is slashing the price the telecom service will pay for Yahoo by at least $250 Million, following revelations of two security breaches last year, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The price cut appears to indicate the troubled deal will go through.

With yet another disclosed security breach, one might think about closing online accounts associated with Yahoo.

Today Yahoo! is all over the Internet, but in a way the company would never have expected.

It all started days ago when Reuters cited some anonymous sources and reported that Yahoo built a secret software to scan the emails of hundreds of millions of its users at the request of a U.S. intelligence service.

At this point, we were not much clear about the intelligence agency: the National Security Agency or the FBI?

The news outlet then reported that the company installed the software at the behest of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court order.

Following the report, the New York Times reported that Yahoo used its system developed to scan for child p*rnography and spam to search for emails containing an undisclosed digital "signature" of a certain method of communication employed by a state-sponsored terrorist organization.

Although Yahoo denied the reports, saying they are "misleading," a series of anonymous sources, therefore, unaccountable, provided media with vague and conflicting info about the scanning tool, its working, for how long and under what authority it was used, and ultimately how it was discovered.


Not an Email Scanner, It was a 'Rootkit' Installed by Government

Yes, now the whole Yahoo saga is getting worse day by day, leaving experts frustrated who are trying to figure out facts from fiction.

The latest twist is a recent Motherboard report, which again cited two anonymous sources, which held previous descriptions of the email scanning tool wrong, saying the tool was much more powerful than other sources reported.

These sources ‚Äî at least one of whom once worked with Yahoo security team ‚Äî said that in reality, the NSA or FBI had secretly installed a "buggy" and poorly designed "backdoor" or "Rootkit" on Yahoo's mail servers.

In technical term, Rootkit is a software program that modifies the operating system in such a way that it gives hackers administrative or "root" control over systems without being detected by the actual administrator of the system.

The backdoor was so secretive that even Yahoo's own security team was kept in the dark about the program. So, when the security team discovered this tool, they believed some hackers had installed a sophisticated and dangerous piece of malware.

The team sounded the alarm, after which the company executives tell them they had installed the tool on the US government request, which resulted in the contentious June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now works at Facebook.

"If it was just a slight modification to the spam and child pornography filters, the security team wouldn't have noticed and freaked out," an anonymous source told Motherboard. "It definitely contained something that did not look like anything Yahoo mail would have installed. This backdoor was installed in a way that endangered all of Yahoo users."
And, apparently it has been reported that the custom-built rootkit/malware code was super buggy and "poorly designed," suggesting that hackers could have exploited it to gain unlimited access to all Yahoo users' data as well as Yahoo's network, the ex-Yahoo source told Motherboard.

And the worst part is that these attacks would be virtually undetectable by either Yahoo's team or the US intelligence agency because the malicious program was designed in a way that administrators can't see what programs are running under a rootkit cloak.

A separate report at the Intercept also has similar claims. So, it could be possible that the same source is going to multiple publications.

"The program that was installed for interception was very carelessly implemented, in a way that if someone like an outside hacker got control of it, they could have basically read everyone's Yahoo mail," an anonymous ex-Yahoo source told The Intercept.

The Whole Yahoo Saga is Getting Worse
Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has been criticized over the Internet to comply with the US government rather than fighting it back. Internet users are saying it's the latest corporate witch-hunt and, unfortunately, it all arrive just in time for Halloween fun.

This whole saga has already cost Yahoo 1 Billion in losses, according to recent reports. After<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>had learned about the recent disclosures about hacking and spying in the past few weeks, it is expecting a Billion discount in the Yahoo acquisition deal, which was initially finalized for $4.8 Billion.

The 2014 hack the company admitted recently¬†exposed over 500 Million accounts, which marked it as the biggest data breach in history. However, some unknown sources claimed that the number might be between 1 Billion and 3 Billion.

There are still many unanswered questions like:

What programs the US government ran on Yahoo's mail servers?
How long was the rootkit in place?
Who actually wrote the rootkit/malware code?
How interconnected Yahoo's other services -- like sports, finance, and photo sharing -- were with its Mail product?
What exactly the government was looking for?
Why Yahoo kept its own security team in the dark?

Forcing Yahoo to actually install a rootkit is a very big deal, which is an indigestible thing because info on individuals could be kept secret but forcing a company to install a backdoor on its server is not supposed to be a secret. That's not how things work.

Yahoo has yet to comment on the issue.

The ISPs can now sell certain sensitive data like your browsing history without permission, thanks to the US Senate.

The US Senate on Wednesday voted, with 50 Republicans for it and 48 Democrats against, to roll back a set of broadband privacy regulations passed by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) last year when it was under Democratic leadership.

In October, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that ISPs would need to get consumers' explicit consent before being allowed to sell their web browsing data to the advertisers or other big data companies.

Before the new rules could take effect on March 2, the President Trump's newly appointed FCC chairman Ajit Pai temporarily put a hold on these new privacy rules.

Ajit Pai argued that the rules, which are regulated by FTC, unfairly favored companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook, who have the ability to collect more data than ISPs and thus dominate digital advertising.

"All actors in the online space should be subject to the same rules, and the federal government shouldn‚Äôt favor one set of companies over another," FCC said in a statement.¬†

"Therefore, he has advocated returning to a technology-neutral privacy framework for the online world and harmonizing the FCC‚Äôs privacy rules for broadband providers with the FTC‚Äôs standards for others in the digital economy."
Pai wanted that the FCC and the FTC should treat all online entities the same way. So those new privacy policies should be scrapped.

If the latest decision gets approval from the House of Representatives and signed by President Trump, this will make it easier for ISPs like<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon,</span> Comcast, and AT&T, to earn more money by collecting and selling data on what you buy, where you browse, and what you search for your home, all without taking your consent.

Since the Senate used the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to overturn the privacy rules, if the repeal is passed, it would not only roll back the FCC's privacy rules but also prevent the regulatory body from making similar privacy regulations in the future if the.

Not surprisingly, the broadband industry applauded the FCC's move, calling it "a welcome recognition that consumers benefit most when privacy protections are consistently applied throughout the Internet ecosystem."
But, of course, privacy advocates are not at all happy with the voting, arguing that the Senate has put ISPs profits over users‚Äô privacy.

The largest known hack of user data in the history just got tripled in size.

Yahoo, the internet company that's acquired by<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon </span>this year, now believes the total number of accounts compromised in the August 2013 data breach, which was disclosed in December last year, was not 1 billion‚Äîit's 3 Billion.

Yes, the record-breaking Yahoo data breach affected every user on its service at the time.

Late last year, Yahoo revealed the company had suffered a massive data breach in August 2013, which affected 1 billion user accounts.

The 2013 hack exposed user account information, including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of births, hashed passwords (using MD5), and, in some cases, "encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers," Yahoo said in 2016.

At that time, Yahoo did confirm that hackers did not obtain bank account details or credit card information tied to the Yahoo accounts.

The data breach was attributed to state-sponsored hackers. Since the disclosure of the breach last year, there have been many developments in the incident.

However, the recent announcement by Yahoo makes it clear that if you had an email account on Yahoo, you were part of the infamous data breach.

Oath, the Verizon subsidiary into which Yahoo was merged, made the announcement in a filing with the SEC on Tuesday, which reads:

"Subsequent to Yahoo's acquisition by Verizon, and during integration, the company recently obtained new intelligence and now believes, following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts, that all Yahoo user accounts were affected by the August 2013 theft."
The statement clearly suggests that if you had an account on Yahoo in 2013, you were affected by the data breach.

So for whatever reason you did not change your password last year after the disclosure of this massive breach, you should now change your passwords immediately and enable two-factor authentication (2FA).

Also, if you are using the same password and answers to security questions somewhere else, change them too.

Deleting Yahoo account may not be a good option to opt for, as Yahoo¬†recycles deleted accounts after 30 days, which would allow anyone to hijack it. So, even if you don't want to use your Yahoo account, just enable 2FA and leave it.

Yahoo has also started notifying the affected account holders, requiring them to change their passwords immediately, and assuring them that the stolen data "did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information."

One should note that this breach is separate from the 2014 breach disclosed by Yahoo in September last year, affecting as many as 500 Million user accounts.

Yahoo attributed the 2014 breach to a state-sponsored hacking group. In March 2016, US federal prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence officers and two criminal hackers in connection with the breach.

Recently, credit reporting service Equifax also announced that an additional 2.5 million American consumers were also impacted by the massive breach the company disclosed last month, bringing the total possible victims to 145.5 million from 143 million.

Researchers have been warning for years about critical issues with the Signaling System 7 (SS7) that could allow hackers to listen in private phone calls and read text messages on a potentially vast scale, despite the most advanced encryption used by cellular networks.

Despite fixes being available for years, the global cellular networks have consistently been ignoring this serious issue, saying that the exploitation of the SS7 weaknesses requires significant technical and financial investment, so is a very low risk for people.

However, earlier this year we saw a real-world attacks, hackers utilised this designing flaw in SS7 to drain victims' bank accounts by intercepting two-factor authentication code (one-time passcode, or OTP) sent by banks to their customers and redirecting it to themselves.

If that incident wasn't enough for the global telecoms networks to consider fixing the flaws, white hat hackers from Positive Technologies now demonstrated how cybercriminals could exploit the SS7 flaw to take control of the online bitcoin wallets to steal all your funds.

Created in the 1980s, SS7 is a telephony signalling protocol that powers over 800 telecom operators across the world, including AT&T and<span class="highlight-match"> Verizon,</span> to interconnect and exchange data, like routing calls and texts with one another, enabling roaming and other services.

Here's How Hackers Hacked into Bitcoin Wallet and Stole FundWhile demonstrating the attack, the Positive researchers first obtained Gmail address and phone number of the target, and then initiated a password reset request for the account, which involved sending a one-time authorization token to be sent to the target's phone number.

Just like in previous SS7 hacks, the Positive researchers were able to intercept the SMS messages containing the 2FA code by exploiting known designing flaws in SS7 and gain access to the Gmail inbox.

From there, the researchers went straight to the Coinbase account that was registered with the compromised Gmail account and initiated another password reset, this time, for the victim's Coinbase wallet. They then logged into the wallet and emptied it of crypto-cash.

Fortunately, this attack was carried out by security researchers rather than cybercriminals, so there wasn't any actual fraud of bitcoin cryptocurrencies.

This issue looks like a vulnerability in Coinbase, but it's not. The real weakness resides in the cellular system itself.

Positive Technologies has also posted a proof-of-concept video, demonstrating how easy it is to hack into a bitcoin wallet just by intercepting text messages in transit.

Different SS7 Attack Scenarios
This attack is not limited to only cryptocurrency wallets. Any service, be it Facebook or Gmail, that relies on two-step verification are vulnerable to the attacks.

The designing flaws in SS7 have been in circulation since 2014 when a team of researchers at German Security Research Labs alerted the world to it.

The flaws could allow hackers to listen to phone calls and intercept text messages on a potentially massive scale, despite the most advanced encryption used by cellular network operators.

Last year, the researchers from Positive Technologies also gave demonstrations on the WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook hacks using the same designing flaws in SS7 to bypass two-factor authentication used by those services.

At TV program 60 Minutes, Karsten Nohl of German Security Research Labs last year demonstrated the SS7 attack on US Congressman Ted Lieu's phone number (with his permission) and successfully intercepted his iPhone, recorded call, and tracked his precise location in real-time just by using his cell phone number and access to an SS7 network.

Although the network operators are unable to patch the issues anytime soon, there's little a smartphone user can do.

Avoid using two-factor authentication via SMS texts for receiving OTP codes. Instead, rely on cryptographically-based security keys as a second authentication factor.

Remember SambaCry?

Almost two months ago, we reported about a 7-year-old critical remote code execution vulnerability in Samba networking software, allowing a hacker to remotely take full control of a vulnerable Linux and Unix machines.

We dubbed the vulnerability as SambaCry, because of its similarities to the Windows SMB vulnerability exploited by the WannaCry ransomware that wreaked havoc across the world over two months ago.

Despite being patched in late May, the vulnerability is currently being leveraged by a new piece of malware to target the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances, researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>warned.

For those unfamiliar: Samba is open-source software (re-implementation of SMB/CIFS networking protocol), which offers Linux/Unix servers with Windows-based file and print services and runs on the majority of operating systems, including Linux, UNIX, IBM System 390, and OpenVMS.

Shortly after the public revelation of its existence, the SambaCry vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) was exploited mostly to install cryptocurrency mining software‚Äî"CPUminer" that mines "Monero" digital currency‚Äîon Linux systems.

However, the latest malware campaign involving SambaCry spotted by researchers at Trend Micro in July mostly targets NAS devices used by small and medium-size businesses.


SHELLBIND Malware Exploits SambaCry to Targets NAS Devices

Dubbed SHELLBIND, the malware works on various architectures, including MIPS, ARM and PowerPC, and is delivered as a shared object (.SO) file to Samba public folders and loaded via the SambaCry vulnerability.

Once deployed on the targeted machine, the malware establishes communication with the attackers' command and control (C&C) server located in East Africa, and modifies firewall rules to ensure that it can communicate with its server.

After successfully establishing a connection, the malware grants the attackers access to the infected device and provides them with an open command shell in the device, so that they can issue any number and type of system commands and eventually take control of the device.

In order to find the affected devices that use Samba, attackers can leverage the Shodan search engine and write the original malware files to their public folders.

"It is quite easy to find devices that use Samba in Shodan: searching for port 445 with a 'samba' string will turn up a viable IP list," researchers said while explaining the flaw.¬†

"An attacker would then simply need to create a tool that can automatically write malicious files to every IP address on the list. Once they write the files into the public folders, the devices with the SambaCry vulnerability could become ELF_SHELLBIND.A victims."
However, it is not clear what the attackers do with the compromised devices and what's their actual motive behind compromising the devices.

The SambaCry vulnerability is hell easy to exploit and could be used by remote attackers to upload a shared library to a writable share and then cause the server to load and execute the malicious code.

The maintainers of Samba already patched the issue in Samba versions 4.6.4/4.5.10/4.4.14, so you are advised to patch your systems against the vulnerability as soon as possible.

Just make sure that your system is running updated Samba version.

Also, attackers need to have writable access to a shared location on the target system to deliver the payload, which is another mitigating factor that might lower the rate of infection.

Hackers and cyber criminals are becoming dramatically more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day.

While other operating systems are more widely in use, cybercriminals have now shifted from traditional activities to more clandestine techniques that come with limitless attack vectors, support for cross platforms and low detection rates.

Security researchers have discovered that infamous Adwind, a popular cross-platform Remote Access Trojan written in Java, has re-emerged and currently being used to "target enterprises in the aerospace industry, with Switzerland, Austria, Ukraine, and the US the most affected countries."

Adwind ‚Äî also known as AlienSpy, Frutas, jFrutas, Unrecom, Sockrat, JSocket, and jRat ‚Äî has been in development since 2013 and is capable of infecting all the major operating systems, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android.


Adwind has several malicious capabilities including stealing credentials, keylogging, taking pictures or screenshots, data gathering and exfiltrate data. The trojan can even turn infected machines into botnets to abuse them for destructing online services by carrying out DDoS attacks.

Researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>recently noticed a sudden rise in the number of Adwind infections during June 2017 ‚Äî at least 117,649 instances in the wild, which is 107 percent more than the previous month.

According to a blog post published today, the malicious campaign was noticed on two different occasions.

First was observed on June 7 and used a link to divert victims to their .NET-written malware equipped with spyware capabilities, while the second wave was noticed on June 14 and used different domains hosting their malware and command-and-control servers.

Both waves eventually employed a similar social engineering tactic to trick victims into clicking the malicious links within a spam email that impersonate the chair of the Mediterranean Yacht Broker Association (MYBA) Charter Committee.

Once infected, the malware also collects system's fingerprints, along with the list of installed antivirus and firewall applications.

"It can also perform reflection, a dynamic code generation in Java. The latter is a particularly useful feature in Java that enables developers/programmers to dynamically inspect, call, and instantiate attributes and classes at runtime. In cybercriminal hands, it can be abused to evade static analysis from traditional antivirus (AV) solutions," the researchers wrote.
My advice for users to remain protected from such malware is always to be suspicious of uninvited documents sent over an email and never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source.

Additionally, keep your systems and antivirus products up-to-date in order to protect against any latest threat.

South Korean web hosting provider has agreed to pay $1 million in bitcoins to hackers after a Linux ransomware infected its 153 servers, encrypting 3,400 business websites and their data, hosted on them.

According to a blog post published by NAYANA, the web hosting company, this unfortunate event happened on 10th June when ransomware malware hit its hosting servers and attacker demanded 550 bitcoins (over $1.6 million) to unlock the encrypted files.

However, the company later negotiated with the cyber criminals and agreed to pay 397.6 bitcoins (around $1.01 million) in three installments to get their files decrypted. 

The hosting company has already paid two installments at the time of writing and would pay the last installment of ransom after recovering data from two-third of its infected servers.

According to the security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro,</span> the ransomware used in the attack was Erebus that was first spotted in September last year and was seen in February this year with Windows‚Äô User Account Control bypass capabilities.



Since the hosting servers were running on Linux kernel 2.6.24.2, researchers believe that Erebus Linux ransomware might have used known vulnerabilities, like DIRTY COW; or a local Linux exploits to take over the root access of the system.

‚ÄúThe version of Apache NAYANA used is run as a user of nobody(uid=99), which indicates that a local exploit may have also been used in the attack,‚Äù researchers note.

‚ÄúAdditionally, NAYANA‚Äôs website uses Apache version 1.3.36 and PHP version 5.1.4, both of which were released back in 2006.‚Äù
Erebus, the ransomware primarily targeting users in South Korea, encrypts office documents, databases, archives, and multimedia files using the RSA-2048 algorithm and then appends them with a .ecrypt extension before displaying the ransom note.

‚ÄúThe file is first scrambled with RC4 encryption in 500kB blocks with randomly generated keys,‚Äù researchers say. ‚ÄúThe RC4 key is then encoded with AES encryption algorithm, which is stored in the file. The AES key is again encrypted using RSA-2048 algorithm¬†that is also stored in the file.‚Äù

The public key which is generated locally is shared, while the private key is encrypted using AES encryption and another randomly generated key.

According to analysis conducted by the Trend Micro researchers, decryption of infected files is not possible without getting hold of the RSA keys.

So, the only safe way of dealing with ransomware attacks is prevention. As we have previously recommended, the best defense against Ransomware is to create awareness within the organizations, as well as to maintain back-ups that are rotated regularly.

Most viruses are introduced by opening infected attachments or clicking on links to malware usually in spam emails. So, DO NOT CLICK on links provided in emails and attachments from unknown sources.

Moreover, ensure that your systems are running the latest version of installed applications.

After the success of Pok√©mon Go, Nintendo's "Super Mario Run" has become the hottest game to hit the market with enormous popularity and massive social impact. The game has taken the world by storm since its launch for iOS devices over a week ago.

Can you believe¬†‚Äî¬†it was downloaded more than 40 million times worldwide in its first four days of release.

But if you have downloaded a Super Mario Run APK for your Android device, Beware! That's definitely a malware.

Since Super Mario Run has currently been released only for iOS devices and is not on Google Play, it caused a lot of disappointment among Android users.

So, eventually, many Android device owners who love Mario games and can not wait to play Super Mario Run ended up downloading APKs outside of the Google Play Store.

But those tons of phony copycat unofficial Super Mario apps on many third-party Android app stores turn out to be malware or viruses that attempt to look like the legitimate Super Mario Run app.


Super Mario can Take Full Control of your Android Device

To download the third party APK, users are required to "side-load" the malicious app by modifying their Android core security settings, allowing their device's operating system to install apps from "untrusted sources."

Some of these malicious apps can even take full control of your Android device, as the apps request privileges to edit, read, receive and send text messages, take photos and record videos and track your location using GPS.

However, one of the apps titled "Super Mario" creates additional icons, displays pop-up and banner ads, installs other malicious apps onto victim's smartphone, and performs other intrusive activities without any users interaction, according to Tokyo-based<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>antivirus firm, which detected malicious Super Mario apps 90,000 times this year.

"Clicking on these ads or icons will direct users to either adult sites or malicious sites. In either case, the goal is to get users to install various apps," researchers at Trend Micro writes.¬†


"While some of these apps are perfectly legitimate, some are suspicious apps distributed by third-party app stores, including more malicious apps that even request for administrator rights."
Another app, also titled "Super Mario" and discovered by the security firm, prompts users first to install an app called 9Apps, which then asks for more permissions, including recording audio, reading modifying the calendar and even access to complete SD-card.


Here's How to Prevent Yourself

So, instead of downloading applications from unknown third party stores, Android users are required to wait for the official Google Play release.

Downloading apps from third parties do not always end up with malware or viruses, but it certainly ups the risk. So, it's the best way to wait to avoid compromising your device and the networks it accesses.

You can also go to Settings ‚Üí Security and make sure "Unknown sources" option is turned off.

Security researchers have recently uncovered a cyber espionage group targeting aerospace, defence and energy organisations in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.

According to the latest research published Wednesday by US security firm FireEye, an Iranian hacking group that it calls Advanced Persistent Threat 33 (or APT33) has been targeting critical infrastructure, energy and military sectors since at least 2013 as part of a massive cyber-espionage operation to gather intelligence and steal trade secrets.

The security firm also says it has evidence that APT33 works on behalf of Iran's government.

FireEye researchers have spotted cyber attacks aimed by APT33 since at least May 2016 and found that the group has successfully targeted aviation sector‚Äîboth military and commercial‚Äîas well as organisations in the energy sector with a link to petrochemical.

The APT33 victims include a U.S. firm in the aerospace sector, a Saudi Arabian business conglomerate with aviation holdings, and a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals.

Most recently, in May 2017, APT33 targeted employees of a Saudi organisation and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice them with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company.

"We believe the targeting of the Saudi organisation may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea‚Äôs recent partnerships with Iran‚Äôs petrochemical industry as well as South Korea‚Äôs relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies," the FireEye report reads.

APT33 targets organisations by sending spear phishing emails with malicious HTML links to infect targets' computers with malware. The malware used by the espionage group includes DROPSHOT (dropper), SHAPESHIFT (wiper) and TURNEDUP (custom backdoor, which is the final payload).

However, in previous research published by Kaspersky, DROPSHOT was tracked by its researchers as StoneDrill, which targeted petroleum company in Europe and believed to be an updated version of Shamoon 2 malware.


"Although we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP backdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT," the report reads.

The SHAPESHIFT malware can wipe disks, erase volumes and delete files, depending on its configuration.

According to FireEye, APT 33 sent hundreds of spear phishing emails last year from several domains, which masqueraded as Saudi aviation companies and international organisations, including Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia.

The security firm also believes APT 33 is linked to Nasr Institute, an Iranian government organisation that conducts cyber warfare operations.

In July, researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>and Israeli firm ClearSky uncovered another Iranian espionage group, dubbed Rocket Kittens, that was also active since 2013 and targeted organisations and individuals, including diplomats and researchers, in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and Germany.

However, FireEye report does not show any links between both the hacking group. For more technical details about the APT33 operations, you can head on to FireEye's official blog post.

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:


Avast (CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)
Avira (CVE-2017-6417)
Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)<span class="highlight-match">
Trend Micro </span>(CVE-2017-5565)
Comodo
ESET
F-Secure
Kaspersky
Malwarebytes
McAfee
Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

Now you can hijack nearly any drone mid-flight just by using a tiny gadget.

Security researcher Jonathan Andersson has devised a small hardware, dubbed Icarus, that can hijack a variety of popular drones mid-flight, allowing attackers to lock the owner out and give them complete control over the device.

Andersson, who is the manager of<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro'</span>s TippingPoint DVLab division, demonstrated this new hack at this year's PacSec security conference in Tokyo, Japan on Wednesday.

Besides Drones, the new gadget has the capability of fully hijacking a wide variety of radio-controlled devices, including helicopters, cars, boats and other remote control gears that run over the most popular wireless transmission control protocol called DSMx.

DSMx is a protocol used to facilitate communication between radio controllers and devices, including drones, helicopters, and cars.

This is not the first hardware that can hijack drones mid-flight. There are jamming devices available in the market that block controlling radio signals and render a drone useless. However, these devices do not give you control like Icarus does.

Icarus works by exploiting DMSx protocol, granting attackers complete control over target drones that allows attackers to steer, accelerate, brake and even crash them.

The loophole relies on the fact that DSMx protocol does not encrypt the 'secret' key that pairs a controller and hobbyist device. So, it is possible for an attacker to steal this secret key by launching several brute-force attacks, Andersson explained in his presentation. 

Once the drone hijacker, Icarus box, grabs the key, an attacker can send malicious packets to restrict the original owner of the drone from sending legitimate control commands. Instead, the drone will accept commands from the attacker.

You can also watch the demonstration video to learn more about Icarus box.


There's little to be done to mitigate this issue, and affected manufacturers are releasing patches and updated hardware, and securing the industry-wide encryption protocol in future drones.

"My guess is that it will not be easy to completely remedy the situation. The manufacturers and partners in the ecosystem sell standalone radio transmitters, models of all kinds, transmitters that come with models and standalone receivers," Andersson told Ars Technica.

"Only a certain set of standalone transmitters have a firmware upgrade capability, though the fix is needed on the model/receiver side."
Icarus has not been made available for sale, but this kind of gadget could benefit law enforcement as well as people who are worried about their safety and privacy. However, same could also be used for nefarious purposes.

So, next time if any annoying drone fly your overhead? Just hijack it and land it safely, rather than shooting it down.

Over 800 different Android apps that have been downloaded millions of times from Google Play Store found to be infected with malicious ad library that silently collects sensitive user data and can perform dangerous operations.

Dubbed "Xavier," the malicious ad library, initially emerged in September 2016, is a member of AdDown malware family, potentially posing a severe threat to millions of Android users.


Since 90 percent of Android apps are free for anyone to download, advertising on them is a key revenue source for their developers. For this, they integrate Android SDK Ads Library in their apps, which usually doesn't affect an app's core functionality.

According to security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro,</span> the malicious ad library comes pre-installed on a wide range of Android applications, including photo editors, wallpapers and ringtone changers, Phone tracking, Volume Booster, Ram Optimizer and music-video player.

Features of Xavier Info-Stealing Malware
The previous variant of Xavier Ad library was a simple adware with an ability to install other APKs silently on the targeted devices, but in the latest release, the malware author has replaced those features with more sophisticated ones, including:
Evade Detection: Xavier is smart enough to escape from being analyzed, from both static and dynamic malware analysis, by checking if it is being running in a controlled environment (Emulator), and using data and communication encryptions.
Remote Code Execution: The malware has been designed to download codes from a remote Command & Control (C&C) server, allowing hackers to remotely execute any malicious code on the targeted device.
Info-Stealing Module: Xavier is configured to steal devices and user related information, which includes user‚Äô email address, Device id, model, OS version, country, manufacturer, sim card operator, resolution, and Installed apps.
According to the researchers, the highest number of infected users are from Southeast countries in Asia such as Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia, with a fewer number of downloads are from the United States and Europe.

Here is a list of 75 infected Android apps that Google has already removed from its Play Store, and if you have installed any of these apps on your device, you are advised to remove it immediately.

Android malware continues to evolve with more sophisticated and never-seen-before capabilities with every passing day. Just last week, we saw first Android malware with code injecting capabilities making rounds on Google Play Store.

How to Protect Yourself
The easiest way to prevent yourself from being targeted by a clever malware like Xavier, always beware of fishy applications, even when downloading them from official Play Store and try to stick to the trusted brands only.

Moreover, always look at the reviews below left by other users who have downloaded the app and verify app permissions before installing any app and grant those permissions that have are relevant for the app's purpose.

Last but not the least, you are strongly advised to always keep a good antivirus application on your device that can detect and block such malware before they can infect your device, and keep your device and apps up-to-date.

	      Two Critical Zero-Day Flaws Disclosed in Foxit PDF Reader [1.17 Points on average]

Are you using Foxit PDF Reader? If yes, then you need to watch your back.

Security researchers have discovered two critical zero-day security vulnerabilities in Foxit Reader software that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on a targeted computer, if not configured to open files in the Safe Reading Mode.

The first vulnerability (CVE-2017-10951) is a command injection bug discovered by researcher Ariele Caltabiano working with<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro'</span>s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), while the second bug (CVE-2017-10952) is a file write issue found by Offensive Security researcher Steven Seeley.

An attacker can exploit these bugs by sending a specially crafted PDF file to a Foxit user and enticing them to open it.

Foxit refused to patch both the vulnerabilities because they would not work with the "safe reading mode" feature that fortunately comes enabled by default in Foxit Reader.

"Foxit Reader & PhantomPDF has a Safe Reading Mode which is enabled by default to control the running of JavaScript, which can effectively guard against potential vulnerabilities from unauthorized JavaScript actions," the company says.
However, researchers believe building a mitigation doesn't patch the vulnerabilities completely, which if remained unpatched, could be exploited if attackers find a way to bypass safe reading mode in the near future.

Both unpatched vulnerabilities can be triggered through the JavaScript API in Foxit Reader.

CVE-2017-10951: The command injection bug resides in an app.launchURL function that executes strings provided by attackers on the targeted system due to lack of proper validation, as demonstrated in the video given below.



CVE-2017-10952: This vulnerability exists within the "saveAs" JavaScript function that allows attackers to write an arbitrary file on a targeted system at any specific location, as demonstrated in the video given below.



"Steven exploited this vulnerability by embedding an HTA file in the document, then calling saveAS to write it to the startup folder, thus executing arbitrary VBScript code on startup," reads the advisory published by the ZDI.
If you are one of those using Foxit Reader and PhantomPDF, ensure you have the "Safe Reading Mode" feature enabled. Additionally, you can also uncheck the "Enable JavaScript Actions" from Foxit's Preferences menu, although this may break some functionality.

Users are also recommended always to be vigilant while opening any files they received via email. Just recently, we reported how opening a malicious PowerPoint file could compromise your computer with malware.

So, always beware of phishing emails, spams, and clicking the malicious attachment.


Update: Foxit Response
Foxit spokesperson has provided the following statement to The Hacker News via an Email:

"Foxit Software is deeply committed to delivering secure PDF products to its customers. Our track record is strong in responding quickly in fixing vulnerabilities. We are currently working to rapidly address the two vulnerabilities reported on the Zero Day Initiative blog and will quickly deliver software improvements. In the meantime, users can help protect themselves by using the Safe Reading Mode."

"We apologize for our initial miscommunication when contacted about these vulnerabilities and are making changes to our procedures to mitigate the probability of it occurring again."

Security researchers have discovered a new, massive cyber espionage campaign that mainly targets people working in government, defence and academic organisations in various countries.

The campaign is being conducted by an Iran-linked threat group, whose activities, attack methods, and targets have been released in a joint, detailed report published by researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>and Israeli firm ClearSky.

Dubbed by researchers CopyKittens¬†(aka Rocket Kittens), the cyber espionage group has been active since at least 2013 and has targeted organisations and individuals, including diplomats and researchers, in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and Germany.

The targeted organisations include government institutions like Ministry of Foreign Affairs, defence companies, large IT companies, academic institutions, subcontractors of the Ministry of Defense, and municipal authorities, along with employees of the United Nations.

The latest report [PDF], dubbed "Operation Wilted Tulip," details an active espionage campaign conducted by the CopyKittens hackers, a vast range of tools and tactics they used, its command and control infrastructure, and the group's modus operandi.


How CopyKittens Infects Its Targets

The group used different tactics to infiltrate their targets, which includes watering hole attacks ‚Äî wherein JavaScript code is inserted into compromised websites to distribute malicious exploits.

The news media and organisations whose websites were abused as watering hole attacks include The Jerusalem Post, for which even German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) issued an alert, Maariv news and IDF Disabled Veterans Organization.

Besides water hole attacks, CopyKittens also used other methods to deliver malware, including:


Emailed links to malicious websites controlled by attackers.
Weaponized Office documents exploiting recently discovered flaw (CVE-2017-0199).
Web servers exploitation using vulnerability scanner and SQLi tools like Havij, sqlmap, and Acunetix.
Fake social media entities to build trust with targets and potentially spread malicious links.



"The group uses a combination of these methods to persistently target the same victim over multiple platforms until they succeed in establishing an initial beachhead of infection ‚Äì before pivoting to higher value targets on the network," Trend Micro writes in a blog post.
In order to infect its targets, CopyKittens makes use of its own custom malware tools in combination with existing, commercial tools, like Red Team software Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, post-exploitation agent Empire, TDTESS backdoor, and credential dumping tool Mimikatz.

Dubbed Matryoshka, the remote access trojan is the group's self-developed malware which uses DNS for command and control (C&C) communication and has the ability to steal passwords, capture screenshots, record keystrokes, collect and upload files, and give the attackers Meterpreter shell access.

"Matryoshka is spread through spear phishing with a document attached to it. The document has either a malicious macro that the victim is asked to enable or an embedded executable the victim is asked to open," Clear Sky says in a blog post.
The initial version of the malware was analysed in 2015 and seen in the wild from July 2016 until January 2017, though the group also developed and used Matryoshka version 2.

Users are recommended to enable two-factor authentication in order to protect their webmail accounts from being compromised, which is a treasure trove of information for hackers, and an "extremely strong initial beachhead" for pivoting into other targets.

Despite the implementation of high-security measures in current devices, the famous Chinese hackers crew has successfully hacked both Apple's iPhone 6S as well as Google's Nexus 6P phones.


Hacking iPhone 6S

For hacking Apple's iPhone 6S, Keen Lab exploited two iOS vulnerabilities ‚Äì a use-after-free bug in the renderer and a memory corruption flaw in the sandbox ‚Äì and stole pictures from the device, for which the team was awarded $52,500.

The iPhone 6S exploit successfully worked despite the iOS 10 update rolled out by Apple this week.

Earlier this week, Marco Grassi from Keen Lab was credited by Apple for finding a serious remote code execution flaw in iOS that could compromise a victim's phone by just viewing "a maliciously crafted JPEG" image.

However, a tweet from Keen Team indicated it was able to make the attack successfully work on iOS 10.1 as well.

The Keen Lab also managed to install a malicious app on the iPhone 6S, but the app did not survive a reboot due to a default configuration setting, which prevented persistence. Still, the ZDI awarded the hackers $60,000 for the vulnerabilities they used in the hack.


Hacking Google's Nexus 6P

For hacking the Nexus 6P, the Keen Lab Team used a combination of two vulnerabilities and other weaknesses in Android and managed to install a rogue application on the Google Nexus 6P phone without user interaction.

The ZDI awarded them a whopping $102,500 for the Nexus 6P hack.

So, of the total potential payout of $375,000 from the Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, the Keen Lab Team researchers took home $215,000.

	      First Android Malware Found Exploiting Dirty COW Linux Flaw to Gain Root Privileges [0.84 Points on average]

Nearly a year after the disclosure of the Dirty COW vulnerability that affected the Linux kernel, cybercriminals have started exploiting the vulnerability against Android users, researchers have warned.

Publicly disclosed last year in October, Dirty COW was present in a section of the Linux kernel‚Äîa part of virtually every Linux distribution, including Red Hat, Debian, and Ubuntu‚Äîfor years and was actively exploited in the wild.

The vulnerability allows an unprivileged local attacker to gain root access through a race condition issue, gain access to read-only root-owned executable files, and permit remote attacks.

However, security researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>published a blog post on Monday disclosing that the privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195), known as Dirty COW, has now been actively exploited by a malware sample of ZNIU, detected as AndroidOS_ZNIU.

This is the first time we have seen a malware sample to contain an exploit for the vulnerability designed to compromise devices running on the mobile platform.


This Dirty Cow Exploit found in Over 1,200 Android Apps

The malware uses the Dirty COW exploit to root Android devices via the copy-on-write (COW) mechanism in Android's Linux kernel and install a backdoor which can then be used by attackers to collect data and generate profit through a premium rate phone number.

Trend Micro researchers detected the ZNIU malware in more than 1,200 malicious Android apps‚Äîsome of which disguised themselves as pornography and gaming apps‚Äîalongside host websites containing malware rootkits that exploit Dirty Cow.

While the Dirty Cow flaw impacts all versions of the Android operating system, the ZNIU's Dirty Cow exploit only affects Android devices with ARM/X86 64-bit architecture. However, the recent exploit can be used to bypass SELinux and plant backdoors.

"We monitored six ZNIU rootkits, four of which were Dirty COW exploits. The other two were KingoRoot, a rooting app, and the Iovyroot exploit (CVE-2015-1805)," the researchers said.¬†

"ZNIU used KingoRoot and Iovyroot because they can root ARM 32-bit CPU devices, which the rootkit for Dirty COW cannot."


Here's How the ZNIU's Dirty Cow exploit Works



Once downloaded and installed, the ZNIU malware-carrying app communicates with its command-and-control (C&C) server to check for code updates, while simultaneously the Dirty Cow exploit provides local privilege escalation to gain root access on the device, bypass system restrictions and "plant a backdoor for potential remote control attacks in the future."

The malware also harvests the carrier information of the user and attempts to send payments via premium SMS messages that were directed to a dummy company in China.

Once the SMS transaction is over, the malware also deletes the messages from the device in order to erase evidence of any compromise.

The researchers found the malware has already infected more than 5,000 Android users across 40 countries in recent weeks, with the majority of victims found in China and India, while other resides in the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany and Indonesia.

Google has released an update for Android that, among other fixes, officially fixes the Dirty COW vulnerability. The tech giant also confirmed that its Play Protect now protects Android users against this malware.

The easiest way to prevent yourself from being targeted by such clever malware is to avoid downloading apps from third-party sources and always stick to the official Google Play Store.

In BriefYou should not miss this month‚Äôs Patch Updates, as it brings fixes for critical issues in Adobe Flash Player, iOS, Xcode, the Apple Watch, Windows, Internet Explorer, and the Edge browser.

Adobe has rolled out a critical update to address several issues, most of which are Remote Code Execution flaws, in its widely-used Adobe Flash Player for Windows, Macintosh, Linux and ChromeOS. Whereas, Microsoft has released 14 security updates to fix a total of 50 vulnerabilities in Windows and related software.
First of all, if you have Adobe Flash Player installed and have not yet updated your software plugin, you are playing with fire.

Critical Flash Vulnerabilities Affect Windows, Mac, Linux and ChromeOS
Adobe has released its latest round of security patches to address critical vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and ChromeOS.

The Flash vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the vulnerable system. So, users are strongly advised to update to Flash Player version 23.0.0.162 before hackers have their hands on it.

However, the best advice I can give you is to ditch this insecure, buggy software once and for all and significantly improve the security of your system in the process.

Even PornHub said Good Bye to Flash Player, so it's no longer an excuse for you to keep Flash on your PC ;)

Meanwhile, Microsoft has released its September 2016 Patch Update that includes 14 bulletins, seven of which earned its most dire "critical" rating and seven are rated as "important," addressing a total of 50 vulnerabilities.

Critical Zero-Day Exploit in the Wild
The most critical vulnerability addressed by Microsoft in the MS16-104 and MS16-105 update is a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer (IE) and Edge.

Dubbed Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2016-3351), the zero-day flaw could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution attacks by tricking a victim to view a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer or Edge.

If exploited successfully, the attacker would gain the same user rights as the current user and could take control of an affected system, if the victim is logged on with administrative user rights, potentially allowing the attacker to install malware, modify or delete data, or even create new accounts with full user rights.

This informational disclosure bug was first reported by Proofpoint researchers with the help of<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>in 2015, when they uncovered a massive malvertising campaign, dubbed AdGholas, actively exploiting the CVE-2016-3351 flaw.

The researchers also found another hacking group named GooNky actively exploiting the flaw. For in-depth details about the flaw, you can head on to Proofpoint's blog post.

Another critical bulletin MS16-108 affecting organizations using Exchange Server for their email platform addresses a file format parsing flaw that could be exploited by attackers using remote-code execution to get full control of the Exchange Server. This flaw affects all supported versions of Exchange Server.

To exploit the flaw, all an attacker needs is to send a malicious file to anyone in the organization and Boom! Exchange Server pre-parses to find out the file type, which would get the malicious exploit triggered before users even get the file.

Other Critical and Important flaws in Windows and its Software
Other critical Bulletins include MS16-106 that fixes five holes in the Windows Graphics Device Interface; MS16-107 that contains patches for Microsoft Office and SharePoint to address a total of 13 vulnerabilities; MS16-116 that fixes a RCE flaw in Microsoft OLE Automation mechanism and the VBScript Scripting Engine; and MS16-117 that includes critical fixes for Adobe Flash libraries contained in Internet Explorer 10 and 11 and Microsoft Edge.

Note: The MS16-11 fix requires users to first apply the Internet Explorer update (MS16-104) in order to be effective.

Important Bulletins include fixes for RCE flaws in Windows, SMBv1 Server and Silverlight; elevation of privilege flaws in the Windows Kernel and Windows Lock Screen; an information disclosure bug in the Windows Secure Kernel Mode; and a pair of information disclosure vulnerabilities in Windows PDF Library.

Users are advised to apply Windows as well as Adobe patches to keep away hackers and cybercriminals from taking control over your computer.

Microsoft Ends Tuesday Patches Trend
The September Patch Update was the last traditional Windows Patch Tuesday as the tech giant is moving to a new patching release model.

The future patch updates will bundle all patches together, and you will no longer be able to select which updates to install. The whole package of patches will be installed altogether, which will leave no chance for hackers to target vulnerabilities for which patches are already released.

In addition, the new "Monthly Rollup" will be combined and delivered to the users. Like the November patch update will also include all the patches from October.

Here we are with our weekly roundup, briefing this week's top cyber security threats, incidents and challenges.

This week has been very short with big news from shutting down of two of the largest Dark Web marketplaces and theft of millions of dollars in the popular Ethereum cryptocurrency to the discovery of new Linux malware leveraging SambaCry exploit.

We are here with the outline of this week's stories, just in case you missed any of them. We recommend you read the entire thing (just click 'Read More' because there's some valuable advice in there as well).

Here's the list of this Week's Top Stories:


1. Feds Shuts Down AlphaBay and Hansa Dark Web Markets ‚Äî Dream Market Under Suspicion

On Thursday, Europol announced that the authorities had shut down two of the largest criminal Dark Web markets ‚Äî AlphaBay and Hansa ‚Äî in what's being called the largest-ever international operation against the dark web's black market conducted by the FBI, DEA and Dutch National Police.

Interestingly, the federal authorities shut down AlphaBay, but before taking down Hansa market, they took control of the Dark Web market and kept it running for at least a month in an effort to monitor the activities of its visitors, including a massive flood of Alphabay refugees.

After the shutdown of both AlphaBay and Hansa, Dream Market has emerged as the leading player, which has been in business since 2013, but it has now been speculated by many dark web users that Dream Market is also under police control.

2. New Ransomware Threatens to Send Your Internet History to All Your Friends

After WannaCry and Petya ransomware outbreaks, a new strain of ransomware has been making the rounds on the Google Play Store in bogus apps, which targets Android mobile phone users.

Dubbed LeakerLocker, instead of encrypting files on your device, this Android ransomware secretly collects personal images, messages and browsing history and then threatens to share them with your contacts if you don't pay $50 (¬£38).

For more detailed information on the LeakerLocker ransomware ‚Äî Read more.


3. New CIA Leaks ‚Äî Smartphone Hacking and Malware Development


WikiLeaks last week published the 16th batch of its ongoing Vault 7 leak, revealing the CIA's Highrise Project that allowed the spying agency to stealthy collect and forwards stolen data from compromised smartphones to its server through SMS messages.

This week, the whistleblowing organisation revealed about a CIA contractor ‚Äî Raytheon Blackbird Technologies ‚Äî who was responsible for analysing advanced malware and hacking techniques being used in the wild by cyber criminals.

For more detailed information on Highrise Project and its contractor Raytheon Blackbird Technologies ‚Äî Read More.


4. Three Back-to-Back Multi-Million Dollar Ethereum Heist in 20 Days

This week, an unknown hacker stole nearly $32 Million worth of Ethereum ‚Äì one of the most popular and increasingly valuable cryptocurrencies ‚Äì from wallet accounts linked to at least three companies by exploiting a critical vulnerability in Parity's Ethereum Wallet software.

This was the third Ethereum cryptocurrency heist that came out two days after an alleged hacker stole $7.4 Million worth of Ether from trading platform CoinDash and two weeks after someone hacked into South Korean cryptocurrency exchange and stole more than $1 Million in Ether and Bitcoins from user accounts.

For more detailed information about the Ethereum Heist ‚Äî Read More.


5. Critical Gnome Flaw Leaves Linux PCs Vulnerable

This week has been bad for Linux users as well. A security researcher discovered a code injection vulnerability in the thumbnail handler component of GNOME Files file manager that allowed hackers to execute malicious code on targeted Linux machines.

German researcher Nils Dagsson Moskopp dubbed the vulnerability Bad Taste (CVE-2017-11421) and also released proof-of-concept (PoC) code on his blog to demonstrate the vulnerability.

For more details about the Bad Taste vulnerability and its PoC ‚Äî Read More.


6. New Malware Exploits SambaCry to Hijack NAS Devices


Despite being patched in late May, the SambaCry vulnerability is currently being leveraged by a new piece of malware to target the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances.

SambaCry is a 7-year-old critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) in Samba networking software that could allow a hacker to remotely take full control of a vulnerable Linux and Unix machines.

The flaw was discovered and patched two months ago, but researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>warned that the flaw had been actively exploited by the SHELLBIND malware that mostly targets NAS devices used by small and medium-size businesses.

For more detailed information on the SHELLBIND malware ‚Äî Read More.


7. Devil's Ivy ‚Äî Millions of Internet-Connected Devices At Risk

This week, researchers at the IoT-focused security firm Senrio discovered a critical remotely exploitable vulnerability in an open-source software development library used by major  IoT manufacturers that eventually left millions of smart devices vulnerable to hacking.

Dubbed Devil's Ivy, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-9765) in the gSOAP toolkit (Simple Object Access Protocol) ‚Äî an advanced C/C++ auto-coding tool for developing XML Web services and XML application.

The researchers also released proof-of-concept (PoC) video demonstrating the RCE on a security camera manufactured by Axis Communications.

For more detailed information on the Devil's Ivy and PoC video ‚Äî Read More.


8. ‚ÄúUbuntu Linux for Windows 10 Released‚Äù ‚Äî Sounds So Weird?

Downloading an entire operating system has just become as easy as downloading an application for Windows 10 users, as Microsoft last week announced the availability of popular Linux distro 'Ubuntu' in the Windows App Store.

While the company announced its plans to launch Fedora and SUSE Linux as well on Windows Store, the company did not reveal exactly when its users can expect to see these two flavours of Linux distro on the App Store.

For detailed information on how to install and run Ubuntu on Windows 10 ‚Äî Read More.


9. Over 70,000 Memcached Servers Vulnerable to Hacking


It's been almost eight months since the Memcached developers have patched several critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in the software, but tens of thousands of servers running Memcached application are still vulnerable.

Cisco's Talos intelligence and research group last year discovered three critical RCE vulnerabilities in Memcached ‚Äî a moderhttp://thehackernews.com/2017/07/segway-hoverboard-hacking.htmln open-source and easily deployable distributed caching system that allows objects to be stored in memory.

The vulnerability exposed major websites including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, to hackers, but the team of researchers scanned the internet on two different occasions and found that over 70,000 servers are still vulnerable to the attacks, including ransomware attacks similar to the one that hit MongoDB databases in late December.

For more in-depth information on the Memcached vulnerabilities ‚Äî Read More.


10. Tor Launches Bug Bounty Program for Public

After its intention to launch a public bug bounty program in late December 2015, the Tor Project has finally launched a "Bug Bounty Program," encouraging hackers and security researchers to find and privately report bugs that could compromise the anonymity network.

The bug bounty reports will be sent through HackerOne ‚Äî a startup that operates bug bounty programs for companies including Yahoo, Twitter, Slack, Dropbox, Uber, General Motors ‚Äì and even the U.S. Department of Defense for Hack the Pentagon initiative.

For detailed information on bug bounty prices and types of valid vulnerabilities ‚Äî Read More.

It is no secret that hackers and cybercriminals are becoming dramatically more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day.

While new forms of cybercrime are on the rise, traditional activities seem to be shifting towards more clandestine techniques that come with limitless attack vectors with low detection rates.

Security researchers have recently discovered a new fileless ransomware, dubbed "Sorebrect," which injects malicious code into a legitimate system process (svchost.exe) on a targeted system and then self-destruct itself in order to evade detection.

Unlike traditional ransomware, Sorebrect has been designed to target enterprise's servers and endpoint. The injected code then initiates the file encryption process on the local machine and connected network shares.

This fileless ransomware first compromises administrator credentials by brute forcing or some other means and then uses Microsoft‚Äôs Sysinternals PsExec command-line utility to encrypt files.

"PsExec can enable attackers to run remotely executed commands, instead of providing and using an entire interactive login session, or manually transferring the malware into a remote machine, like in RDPs,"<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>says.


Sorebrect Also Encrypts Network Shares

Sorebrect also scans the local network for other connected computers with open shares and locks files available on them as well.

"If the share has been set up such that anyone connected to it has read-and-write access to it, the share will also be encrypted," researchers say.
The nasty ransomware then deletes all event logs (using wevtutil.exe) and shadow copies (using vssadmin) on the infected machine that could provide forensic evidence such as files executed on the system and their timestamps, which makes this threat hard-to-detect.

In addition, Sorebrect uses the Tor network protocol in an attempt to anonymize its communication with its command-and-control (C&C) server, just like almost every other malware.


Sorebrect Ransomware Spreads Worldwide

The Sorebrect fileless ransomware has been designed to target systems from various industries including manufacturing, technology, and telecommunications.

According to Trend Micro, Sorebrect was initially targeting Middle Eastern countries like Kuwait and Lebanon, but from last month, this threat has started infecting people in Canada, China, Croatia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Taiwan, and the U.S.

"Given ransomware‚Äôs potential impact and profitability, it wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise if SOREBRECT turns up in other parts of the world, or even in the cybercriminal underground where it can be peddled as a service," the researchers note.
This is not the first time when researchers have come across Fileless malware. Two months ago, Talos researchers discovered a DNSMessenger attack that was completely Fileless and used DNS TXT messaging capabilities to compromise systems.

In February, Kaspersky researchers also discovered fileless malware that resided solely in the memory of the compromised computers, which was found targeting banks, telecommunication companies, and government organizations in 40 countries.


Ways to Protect Against Ransomware Attacks

Since the ransomware does not target individuals but organizations, sysadmins and information security professionals can protect themselves by:

Restricting user write permissions: a significant factor that exposes network shares to ransomware by giving users full permissions.
Limiting privilege for PsExec: Limit PsExec and provide permission to run them only to system administrators.
Keeping your system and network up-to-date: Always keep your operating system, software, and other applications updated.
Backing up your data regularly: To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC.
Adopting a cyber security-aware workforce: Educating your employees about malware, threat vectors and security measure always plays a major role in any organization.

The Shadow Brokers who previously stole and leaked a portion of the NSA hacking tools and exploits is back with a Bang!

The hacking group is now selling another package of hacking tools, ‚ÄúEquation Group Windows Warez,‚Äù which includes Windows exploits and antivirus bypass tools, stolen from the NSA-linked hacking unit, The Equation Group.

For those unfamiliar with the topic, The Shadow Brokers is a notorious group of black-hat hackers who, in August 2016, leaked exploits, security vulnerabilities, and "powerful espionage tools" created by The Equation Group.

On Saturday, the Shadow Brokers posted a message on their ZeroNet based website, announcing the sale of the entire "Windows Warez" collection for 750 Bitcoin (around US$678,630).

The data dump contains many windows hacking tools, categorized as following:

Fuzzing tools (used to discover errors and security loopholes)
Exploit Framework
Network Implants
Remote Administration Tools (RAT)
Remote Code Execution Exploits for IIS, RDP, RPC, SMB Protocols (Some Zero-Days)
SMB BackDoor (Implant)

Interestingly, the Remote Administration Tool (RAT) "DanderSpritz" included in the list is the one previously leaked in the NSA's documents revealed by Edward Snowden.

Besides this, malware researcher Jacob Williams analyzed the archive of "screenshots and output of the find command across the dump" provided by the hacker as an evidence of legitimacy and estimated that the tools may also include a Fully Undetectable Malware (FUD) toolkit.


The FUD toolkit might have an ability to "evade/bypass personal security products," such as Avira, Avast, Dr.Web, ESET Antivirus, Comodo, McAfee Antivirus, Microsoft Essential, Panda, Symantec,<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro </span>and Kaspersky Antivirus.

The buyers can purchase the entire database of hacking tools that The Equation Group used against various countries to expand its espionage operations.

In August, the Shadow Brokers announced an auction attempting to sell the complete set of tools to the highest bidder, but the group canceled their auction in October due to little or no response on their public sale.

But since this time the group has made Windows hacking tools up for sale, the chances are that hackers and espionage groups would be interested in buying these hacking tools.

A few months back we reported how opening a simple MS Word file could compromise your computer using a critical vulnerability in Microsoft Office.

The Microsoft Office remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) resided in the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) interface for which a patch was issued in April this year, but threat actors are still abusing the flaw through the different mediums.

Security researchers have spotted a new malware campaign that is leveraging the same exploit, but for the first time, hidden behind a specially crafted PowerPoint (PPSX) Presentation file.

According to the researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro,</span> who spotted the malware campaign, the targeted attack starts with a convincing spear-phishing email attachment, purportedly from a cable manufacturing provider and mainly targets companies involved in the electronics manufacturing industry.

Researchers believe this attack involves the use of a sender address disguised as a legitimate email sent by a sales and billing department.

Here's How the Attack Works:

The complete attack scenario is listed below:


Step 1: The attack begins with an email that contains a malicious PowerPoint (PPSX) file in the attachment, pretending to be shipping information about an order request.

Step 2: Once executed, the PPSX file calls an XML file programmed in it to download "logo.doc" file from a remote location and runs it via the PowerPoint Show animations feature.

Step 3: The malformed Logo.doc file then triggers the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability, which downloads and executes RATMAN.exe on the targeted system.

Step 4: RATMAN.exe is a Trojanized version of the Remcos Remote Control tool, which when installed, allows attackers to control infected computers from its command-and-control server remotely.


Remcos is a legitimate and customizable remote access tool that allows users to control their system from anywhere in the world with some capabilities, like a download and execute the command, a keylogger, a screen logger, and recorders for both webcam and microphone.

Since the exploit is used to deliver infected Rich Text File (.RTF) documents, most detection methods for CVE-2017-0199 focuses on the RTF. So, the use of a new PPSX files allows attackers to evade antivirus detection as well.

The easiest way to prevent yourself completely from this attack is to download and apply patches released by Microsoft in April that will address the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability.

Today, many automobiles companies are offering vehicles that run on the mostly drive-by-wire system, which means a majority of car's functions‚Äîfrom instrument cluster to steering, brakes, and accelerator‚Äîare electronically controlled.

No doubt these auto-control systems make your driving experience much better, but at the same time, they also increase the risk of getting hacked.

Car Hacking is a hot topic, though it is not new for security researchers who hack cars. A few of them have already demonstrated how to hijack a car remotely, how to disable car's crucial functions like airbags, and even how to remotely steal cars.

Now, security researchers have discovered a new hacking trick that can allow attackers to disable airbags and other safety systems of the connected cars, affecting a large number of vendors and vehicle models.

A team of researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Trend Micro'</span>s Forward-looking Threat Research (FTR) team, in collaboration with Politecnico di Milano and Linklayer Labs, discovered a critical security vulnerability in the CAN (controller area network) protocol that car components use to communicate to one another within the car's network.


Hackers Can Remotely Take Control of Smart Cars


Initially developed in 1983 and put into production in 1989, the CAN standard manages the majority of the electrical subsystems and control units found in a significant number of modern smart cars.

If exploited, the vulnerability could eventually allow attackers to turn off crucial safety functions of a vehicle, such as airbags, power-steering, parking sensors, and the anti-lock brakes‚Äîor almost any computerised component that's connected to the car's CAN bus.

Since the CAN standard is being used in "practically every light-duty vehicle currently in circulation today," the fundamental security flaw affects all modern, internet-connected vehicles, rather than just a particular vendor.


How Your Smart Car Can Get Hacked?

The hack particularly targets the messaging system in CAN, in which messages, including errors, are called "frames."


"Our attack focuses on how CAN handles errors. Errors arise when a device reads values that do not correspond to the original expected value on a frame," Trend Micro researcher Federico Maggi writes in a blog post.


"When a device detects such an event, it writes an error message onto the CAN bus in order to "recall" the errant frame and notify the other devices to entirely ignore the recalled frame."

By overloading the system with error messages, attackers can make a device to go into a Bus Off state, cutting it off from the greater CAN system and making it inoperable. 

This, in turn, allows attackers to deactivate essential systems like the airbag system or the anti-lock braking system, which could result in dangerous and even fatal situations.

The attack requires a "specially-crafted attack device" to be introduced via local access, which is only possible if the attacker has access to your vehicle.

However, researchers believe that current transportation trends like ride-sharing, carpooling, and car renting have made the scenario much easier.


It's a Design Flaw ‚Äî Can't Be Patched!


Since the vulnerability exists in the design of the CAN bus messaging protocol used in CAN controller chips, the issue can not be directly patched with an OTA (on-the-air) upgrade or dealer recall.

Patching this design flaw requires changes in the CAN standards and an entire generation of vehicles using this specification. So, unfortunately, there is no remedy to the problem yet.

However, the researchers recommended car manufacturers to adopt some network countermeasures, which would mitigate such attacks, but not entirely.


"Car manufacturers can only mitigate the attack we demonstrated by adopting specific network countermeasures, but cannot eliminate it entirely," the researchers said.


"To eliminate the risk entirely, an updated CAN standard should be proposed, adopted, and implemented. This whole process would likely require another generation of vehicles."

Researchers also suggest car makers even to consider adding a layer of encryption to the CAN bus protocol that will make messages harder to mimic, as part of a long-term security solution.

The hacker group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, who previously claimed to have leaked a portion of the NSA‚Äôs hacking tools and exploits, is back with a Bang!

The Shadow Brokers published more files today, and this time the group dumped a list of foreign servers allegedly compromised by the NSA-linked hacking unit, Equation Group, in various countries to expand its espionage operations.


Top 3 Targeted Countries ‚Äî China, Japan, and Korea

The data dump¬†[Download / File Password: payus] that experts believe contains 306 domain names, and 352 IP addresses belong to at least 49 countries. As many as 32 domains of the total were run by educational institutes in China and Taiwan.

A few target domains were based in Russia, and at least nine domains include .gov websites.

The top 10 targeted countries include China, Japan, Korea, Spain, Germany, India, Taiwan, Mexico, Italy, and Russia.

The latest dump has been signed by the same key as the first Shadow Brokers‚Äô dump of NSA exploits, though there is a lot to be done to validate the contents of the leaked data dump fully.


Targeted Systems ‚Äî Solaris, Unix, Linux and FreeBSD

Most of the affected servers were running Solaris,<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle-</span>owned Unix-based operating system, while some were running FreeBSD or Linux.

Each compromised servers were reportedly targets of INTONATION and PITCHIMPAIR, code-names given for cyber-spy hacking programs.

The data dump also contains references to a list of previously undisclosed Equation Group tools, including Dewdrop, Incision, Orangutan, Jackladder, Reticulum, Patchicillin, Sidetrack and Stoicsurgeon.

The tools as mentioned above could be hacking implants, tools or exploits used by the NSA's notorious group.

Security researcher Mustafa Al-Bassam, an ex-member of Lulzsec and the Anonymous hacking collective, said the NSA likely compromised all the servers between 2000 and 2010.

"So even the NSA hacks machines from compromised servers in China and Russia. This is why attribution is hard," Al-Bassam added.¬†

Are Hackers trying to influence U.S. Presidential elections?

A message accompanying the leaked data dump calls for attempts to disrupt the forthcoming United States presidential election. The portion of message from the Shadow Brokers reads:

"TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. On November 8th, instead of not voting, maybe be stopping the vote all together? Maybe being grinch who stopped the election from coming? Maybe hacking election is being the best idea? #hackelection2016."
Targeted victims can use the leaked files in an effort to determine if they were the potential target of the NSA-linked hacking unit.

Since the records are old, many servers should now be clean of infection. However, a brief Shodan scan of these domains indicates that some of the affected servers are still active and still running old, possibly-vulnerable systems.

The latest release comes after the FBI arrested Harold Thomas Martin, an NSA contractor, who was reportedly a prime suspect in The Shadow Brokers case.

Remember The Shadow Brokers? They are back.

A hackers group that previously claimed to have stolen a bunch of hacking tools (malware, zero-day exploits, and implants) created by the NSA and gained popularity last year for leaking a portion of those tools is back.

Today, The Shadow Brokers group released more alleged hacking tools and exploits that, the group claims, belonged to "Equation Group" ‚Äì an elite cyber attack unit linked to the NSA.
 

Besides dumping some NSA's hacking tools back in August 2016, the Shadow Brokers also released an encrypted cache of files containing more NSA's hacking tools and exploits in an auction, asking for 1 Million Bitcoins (around $568 Million).

However, after failed auction, the group put up those hacking tools and exploits for direct sale on an underground website, categorizing them into a type ‚Äî like "exploits," "Trojans," and "implant" ‚Äî each of which ranged from 1 to 100 Bitcoins (from $780 to $78,000).

Now, the Shadow Brokers has finally released password for the encrypted cache of NSA's files, allowing anyone to unlock and download the auction data dump.


CrDj‚Äù(;Va.*NdlnzB9M?@K2)#>deB7mN

The password mentioned above for the encrypted NSA files was made public through a blog post published today.

The blog post, titled "Don't Forget Your Base," has been written as an open letter to President Donald Trump, containing political views expressed by the Shadow Brokers on Trump's recent policies and events, like the Goldman Sach, the air strike against Syria and removal of Steve Bannon from the National Security Council, among others.

A security researcher, who uses Twitter handle x0rz, has uploaded all files after decryption on Github and confirmed that the archive includes:


rpc.cmsd a remote root zero-day exploit for Solaris ‚Äì<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle-</span>owned Unix-based operating system.
The TOAST framework that NSA's TAO (Tailored Access Operations) team used to clean logs of Unix wtmp events.
The Equation Group's ElectricSlide tool that impersonates a Chinese browser with fake Accept-Language.
The evidence of the NSA operators' access inside the GSM network of Mobilink, one of the Pakistan's popular mobile operator companies.


More key findings will come as soon as other security researchers delve into the dump.

At the time, it's not confirmed whether the group holds more NSA hacking tools and exploits or this is the last batch of documents the Shadow Brokers stole from the United States intelligence organization.

	      An Army of Thousands of Hacked Servers Found Mining Cryptocurrencies [1.08 Points on average]

A new botnet consisting of more than 15,000 compromised servers has been used to mine various cryptocurrencies, earning its master around $25,000 per month.

Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment, as it requires an enormous amount of computing power, but cybercriminals have found an easy money-making solution.

Dubbed BondNet, the botnet was first spotted in December 2016 by GuardiCore researchers, who traced back the botnet malware developer, using online handle Bond007.01, to China.

According to the GuardiCore researchers, Bond007.01 is currently using BondNet for mining cryptocurrencies ‚Äî primarily Monero, but also ByteCoin, RieCoin, and ZCash ‚Äî but they warn that the hacker could easily take full control of compromised servers for malicious purposes, like mounting Mirai-style DDoS attacks.




BondNet Attacks only Windows Server Machines

Since mining cryptocurrencies require large amounts of CPU/GPU power, the botnet master goes after Windows Server machines; instead of consumer IoT devices.

However, in order to compromise Windows Server machines, the botnet master relies on different attack techniques. Researchers say the hacker uses a combination of old vulnerabilities and weak user/password combinations to attack mostly old and unsupported Windows Server machines.

The most common flaws exploited by the botnet operator include known phpMyAdmin configuration flaws, exploits in JBoss, and bugs in<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle </span>Web Application Testing Suite, MSSQL servers, ElasticSearch, Apache Tomcat, Oracle Weblogic, and other services.

Once the hacker gain access to a Windows Server machine, he deploys Visual Basic files to gather information about the infected system and then install a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and a cryptocurrency miner to make a huge profit from the hacked servers.




BondNet's Botnet Infrastructure

One thing that's worth noticing is that the botnet operator does not use all infected machines for mining cryptocurrencies. The operator has built its botnet infrastructure of compromised servers with various roles:

1. Some infected machines serve as scanning servers to check for vulnerable systems on the Internet by going through a list of IP addresses with open ports that have been compiled with the WinEggDrop TCP port scanner.

2. Some servers are used as file servers to host the mining software.

3.¬†Other infected servers are turned into command-and-control (C&C) servers after they have been equipped with a fork of goup ‚Äî a small open source HTTP server written in Golang.

"Building an attack infrastructure on top of victim machines helps conceal the attacker‚Äôs true identity and origin of the attack," the GuardiCore researchers explained in their report published Thursday.¬†

"It also provides high availability infrastructure, which is very helpful when relying on compromised servers, providing infinite backup options in case one of the servers fails or loses connectivity to the internet."
BondNet has already infected more than 15,000 server machines at major institutions around the world, including high-profile global companies, universities, and city councils, while the majority of them runs Windows Server 2008 R2.

Additionally, the BondNet botnet adds around 500 new machines to its network each day, and an approximately the same number of servers are delisted.


Here's How to Detect the Threat and How to Mitigate:

To prevent your machines from getting hacked, server admins are advised to secure their systems by regularly applying security patches for all software, updating the firmware, and employing stronger passwords.

Meanwhile, GuardiCore has also provided network and file indicators of compromise systems to help server administrators check whether their machines are among compromised ones.

The researchers have also released a detection & cleanup tool (registration is required to download it) to help admins find and remove BondNet bots from their servers, as well as instructions on how to clean the system manually, without using the script.

You won't believe your eyes while reading this, but this is true. Microsoft just joined the Linux Foundation as a high-paying Platinum member.

Microsoft's love with open source community is embracing as time passes. At its first Connect event in 2013, the company launched Visual Studio 2013. A year later, Microsoft open sourced .NET, and last year, it open sourced the Visual Studio Code Editor, as well.

Not just that, Microsoft partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu on Windows 10, worked with FreeBSD to develop a Virtual Machine image for its Azure cloud, and chosen Ubuntu as the OS for its Cloud-based Big Data services.


And the big news for this year is‚Ä¶

At its 2016 Connect developer event in New York today, Microsoft announced that the company is joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member ‚Äì the highest level of membership, which costs $500,000 annually.

Besides this, Microsoft also announced that tech giant Google has also joined on with the independent .NET Foundation.

The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit organization that oversees the development of the very popular free operating system Linux, alongside advances open technology development as well as commercial adoption.

Microsoft has already contributed to a number of its open source projects, including Node.js Foundation, Open Container Initiative, OpenDaylight, R Consortium, and Open API Initiative.

However, today's announcement from Microsoft still comes as a surprise to many, as Former Microsoft Chief Steve Ballmer once said, "Linux is a cancer,"¬†in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times.

Here's what Microsoft said in its latest announcement for joining the Linux Foundation:


"As part of its effort to work more closely with the open source community, Microsoft on Wednesday announced it has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member. Microsoft's membership in the Linux Foundation will benefit customers through increased collaboration and innovation among a diverse ecosystem."

Microsoft believes its latest move will benefit its customers through increased collaboration and innovation.

Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, also acknowledged the company's move to work more closely with the open-source community, saying:


"By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people. Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development."

Other Linux Foundation Platinum members include Cisco, Huawei, IBM, Intel,<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle,</span> Qualcomm, Samsung, Fujitsu, HPE, and NEC. While Gold sponsors include Google, Facebook and more than a dozen other prominent open source users.

The infamous hacking collective Shadow Brokers ‚Äì the one who leaked the Windows SMB exploit in public that led to last weekend's WannaCrypt menace ‚Äì are back, this time, to cause more damage.

In typically broken English, the Shadow Brokers published a fresh statement (with full of frustration) a few hours ago, promising to release more zero-day bugs and exploits for various desktop and mobile platforms starting from June 2017.

However, this time the Shadow Brokers leaks will not be available for everybody, as the hacking collective said:

"TheShadowBrokers is launching new monthly subscription model. Is being like [the] wine of month club. Each month peoples can be paying membership fee, then getting members only data dump each month."

To some extent, this is good news, but it is terrible news too. Good because now all these upcoming alleged unpatched vulnerabilities will be patched after being disclosed and terrible because the group will sell new zero-day exploits and hacking tools to private members with paid monthly subscription, instead of telling them to Microsoft.

Apparently, other hackers, criminal gangs, state-sponsored hackers, maybe some journalists and people from tech companies, would naturally join Shadow Brokers' membership.


Get Ready for the 'Wine of Month Club'

So, anyone buying the membership of the "wine of month club" would be able to get exclusive access to the upcoming leaks, which the Shadow Brokers claims would include:


Exploits for web browsers, routers, and smartphones.
Exploits for operating systems, including Windows 10.
Compromised data from banks and Swift providers.
Stolen network information from Russian, Chinese, Iranian, and North Korean nuclear missile programs.


The claims made by the group remain unverified at the time of writing, but since the Shadow Brokers' previously released data dump turned out to be legitimate, the group's statement should be taken seriously, at least now, when we know the EternalBlue exploit and DoublePulsar backdoor developed by the NSA and released by the Shadow Brokers last month was used by WannaCry to cause chaos worldwide.

Before publicly dumping these exploits in April, the Shadow Brokers put an auction of cyber weapons stolen from NSA‚Äôs elite hacking team called Equation Group for 1 Million Bitcoin.

After failed auction, the hacking group even put up those hacking tools and exploits for direct sale on an underground site, categorizing them into a type ‚Äî like "exploits," "Trojans," and "implant" ‚Äî each of which ranged from 1 to 100 Bitcoins (from $780 to $78,000).

After failure from all sides, the group started leaking those hacking exploits. Last month, the Shadow Brokers released a Microsoft Windows SMB exploit that was used by the WannaCry ransomware, which infected 200,000 machines in 150 countries within just 48 hours.

While talking about the WannaCry ties with North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus Group, the group said:

"The<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle </span>is telling theshadowbrokers North Korea is being responsible for the global cyber attack Wanna Cry. Nukes and cyber attacks, America has to go to war, no other choices!"


Shadow Brokers Lashed out on US Government and Tech Companies

In its recent post, the Shadow Brokers criticized both the US government and tech companies, such as Microsoft, for not cracking down on the exploits when they had the chance, months before their release.

The hacking group said the US government is paying tech companies not to patch zero-days in their products, claiming that it has spies inside Microsoft among other US tech firms.

The Shadow Brokers even accused Google Project Zero team, saying:

"TheShadowBrokers is thinking Google Project Zero is having some former TheEquationGroup member. Project Zero recently releasing "Wormable Zero-Day" Microsoft patching in record time, knowing it was coming? Coincidence?"

Who knows if these accusation made by the Shadow Brokers group are true or not, but the world should be well prepared for another WannaCry-like massive destroyer.

Yes,<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle </span>just bought the DNS provider company that brought down the Internet last month.

Business software vendor Oracle announced on Monday that it is buying cloud-based Internet performance and Domain Name System (DNS) provider Dyn.

Dyn is the same company that was hit by a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack by the Mirai botnet last month which knocked the entire Internet offline for a few hours, crippling some of the world's biggest and most popular websites.

Since the company provides cloud-based DNS service to customers such as Spotify, Netflix, Twitter and Pfizer, the acquisition will help Oracle's cloud customers to optimize their infrastructure costs and performance.

According to the press release, the Dyn acquisition "extends the Oracle cloud computing platform and provides enterprise customers with a one-stop shop for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)."

"Oracle Cloud customers will have unique access to Internet performance information that will help them optimize infrastructure costs, maximize application and website-driven revenue, and manage risk," said Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn.
The company said Dyn's immensely scalable and global DNS is not just a critical core component but also provides a natural extension to Oracle's cloud computing platform.

So, the deal would help its cloud customers improve access and page-load speeds for their websites using internet performance information.

Oracle did not disclose the acquisition amount it paid for Dyn, but a source close to the deal told Fortune that Oracle paid somewhere between $600 Million and $700 Million to acquire Dyn.

Dan Primack reported that Oracle paid around $600 million for Dyn, though Dyn has yet to respond to a request for comment.

Oracle is far behind Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the market leader in the infrastructure cloud computing market. The deal would potentially make the company compete with Amazon's AWS and on Microsoft's Azure ‚Äì Route 53 and Azure DNS.

Update: Most of the exploits made publicly available (mentioned in this article) by the Shadow Brokers group are already patched by Microsoft in the last month's Patch Tuesday update.

 So, it is always recommended that you keep your systems up-to-date in order to prevent you from being hacked.

The Shadow Brokers ‚Äì a hackers group that claimed to have stolen a bunch of hacking tools from the NSA ‚Äì released today more alleged hacking tools and exploits that target earlier versions of Windows operating system, along with evidence that the Intelligence agency also targeted the SWIFT banking system of several banks around the world.

Last week, the hacking group released the password for an encrypted cache of Unix exploits, including a remote root zero-day exploit for Solaris OS, and the TOAST framework the group put on auction last summer.

The hacking tools belonged to "Equation Group" ‚Äì an elite cyber attack unit linked to the National Security Agency (NSA).

Now, the Shadow Brokers group just published a new 117.9 MB of encrypted archive via its new blog post, titled "Lost in Translation," which can be unlocked by anyone using password "Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee."

Someone has already uploaded the unlocked archive on GitHub and listed all the files contained in the dump released by the Shadow Brokers, which includes 23 new hacking tools.

These hacking tools have been named as OddJob, EasyBee, EternalRomance, FuzzBunch, EducatedScholar, EskimoRoll, EclipsedWing, EsteemAudit, EnglishMansDentist, MofConfig, ErraticGopher, EmphasisMine, EmeraldThread, EternalSynergy, EwokFrenzy, ZippyBeer, ExplodingCan, DoublePulsar, and others.

Security researchers have started delving into the dump to determine the capabilities of the alleged exploits, implants and payloads that are claimed to work against Windows platforms.


NSA DUMP: Windows, Swift, and OddJob

The latest dump comprises of 3 folders: Windows, Swift, and OddJob.

"So this week is being about money. TheShadowBrokers showing you cards theshadowbrokers wanting you to be seeing. Sometime peoples not being target audience. Follow the links for new dumps. Windows. Swift. Oddjob," the Shadow Brokers latest blog post reads.
The Windows folder holds many hacking tools against Windows operating system, but works against only older version of Windows (Windows XP) and Server 2003, according to researchers.


‚ÄúETERNALBLUE is a #0day RCE exploit that affects latest & updated Windows 2008 R2 SERVER VIA SMB and NBT!‚Äù tweeted the security researcher known as Hacker Fantastic on Twitter.

Another folder, named OddJob, contains a Windows-based implant and includes alleged configuration files and payloads. While the details on this implant are scarce at the moment, OddJob works on Windows Server 2003 Enterprise up to Windows XP Professional.


Some of the Windows exploits were even undetectable on online file scanning service VirusTotal, Security Architect Kevin Beaumont confirmed via Twitter, which indicates that the tools have not been seen before.


"A lot of good remote exploits in the #EquationGroup tools. Just a few well-designed 0days is enough to pwn the planet," tweeted another security researcher, who uses Twitter handle x0rz.

The SWIFT folder contains PowerPoint presentations, evidence, credentials and internal architecture of EastNets, one of the largest SWIFT Service Bureau in the Middle East.


SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Telecommunication) is a global financial messaging system that thousands of banks and organizations across the world use to transfer billions of dollars every day.


"A SWIFT Service Bureau is the kind of the equivalent of the Cloud for Banks when it comes to their SWIFT transactions and messages; the banks' transactions are hosted and managed by the SWIFT Service Bureau via an<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle </span>Database and the SWIFT Softwares," security researcher Matt Suiche explains in a blog post.

The folder includes SQL scripts that search for information from the Oracle Database like the list of database users and the SWIFT message queries.


Besides this, the folder also contains Excel files that indicate that the NSA's elite cyber attack unit Equation Group had hacked and gained access to many banks around the world, the majority of which are located in the Middle East like UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Palestine, and Yemen.

"SWIFT Host of Palestinian Bank was running Windows 2008 R2 vulnerable to exploit framework FUZZBUNCH." Matt tweeted.
More key findings will come as soon as other security researchers delve into the latest dump.

This release is the latest from the Shadow Brokers desk and at the moment, it's not confirmed whether the hacking group holds more NSA hacking tools and exploits or this one is the last batch it stole from the United States intelligence organization.


UPDATE:¬†EastNets Denies SWIFT Hacking Claims

In an official statement published today, EastNets denies that its SWIFT bureau was compromised, and says the reports of hack are "totally false and unfounded."

"The reports of an alleged hacker-compromised EastNets Service Bureau (ENSB) network is totally false and unfounded. The EastNets Network internal Security Unit has run a complete check of its servers and found no hacker compromise or any vulnerabilities."

"The EastNets Service Bureau runs on a separate secure network that cannot be accessed over the public networks. The photos shown on twitter, claiming compromised information, is about pages that are outdated and obsolete, generated on a low-level internal server that is retired since 2013."

Over a month ago we reported about two critical zero-day vulnerabilities in the world's 2nd most popular database management software MySQL:

MySQL Remote Root Code Execution (CVE-2016-6662)
Privilege Escalation (CVE-2016-6663)

At that time, Polish security researcher Dawid Golunski of Legal Hackers who discovered these vulnerabilities published technical details and proof-of-concept exploit code for the first bug only and promised to release details of the second bug (CVE-2016-6663) later.

On Tuesday, Golunski has released proof-of-concept (POC) exploits for two vulnerabilities:

One is the previously promised critical privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-6663), and another is a new root privilege escalation bug (CVE-2016-6664) that could allow an attacker to take full control over the database.

Both the vulnerabilities affect MySQL version 5.5.51 and earlier, MySQL version 5.6.32 and earlier, and MySQL version 5.7.14 and earlier, as well as MySQL forks ‚Äî Percona Server and MariaDB.


Privilege Escalation/Race Condition Bug (CVE-2016-6663)


The more severe of the two is the race condition bug (CVE-2016-6663) that can allow a low-privileged account (with CREATE/INSERT/SELECT grants) with access to the affected database to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code as the database system user (i.e. 'mysql').

Once exploited, an attacker could successfully gain access to all databases within the affected database server.


Root Privilege Escalation (CVE-2016-6664)

Another critical flaw in MySQL database is a root privilege escalation bug that could allow attackers with 'MySQL system user' privilege to further escalate their privileges to root user, allowing them to fully compromise the system.

The issue actually stems from unsafe file handling of error logs and other files, which comes under MySQL system user privileges, allowing it to be replaced with an arbitrary system file, which opens the door to root privileges.

What's more troublesome? An attacker with a low-privileged account can also achieve root privilege by first exploiting the Privilege Escalation flaw (CVE-2016-6663) to become 'MySQL system user' and thus allow attackers to fully compromise the targeted server.

All these vulnerabilities could be exploited in shared hosting environments where users are assigned access to separate databases. By exploiting the flaws, they could gain access to all databases.

Golunski has published the proof-of-concept exploit code (Exploit 1, Exploit 2) for both the flaws and will soon upload videos.

MySQL has fixed the vulnerabilities and all of the patches ultimately found their way into<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle'</span>s quarterly Critical Patch Update last month.

Administrators are strongly advised to apply patches as soon as possible in order to avoid hackers seeking to exploit the vulnerabilities. 

If you are unable to immediately apply patches, then as a temporary mitigation you can also disable symbolic link support within your database server configuration to this setting ‚Äî¬†my.cnf to symbolic-links = 0¬†‚Äî in an attempt to protect yourself against cyber attacks.

The risks associated with data breaches continue to grow, impacting a variety of industries, tech firms, and social networking platforms. In the past few months, over 1 Billion credentials were dumped online as a result of mega breaches in popular social networks.

Now,<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle </span>is the latest in the list.

Oracle has confirmed that its MICROS division ‚Äì which is one of the world's top three point-of-sale (POS) services the company acquired in 2014 ‚Äì has suffered a security breach.

Hackers had infected hundreds of computers at Oracle's point-of-sale division, infiltrated the support portal used by customers, and potentially accessed sales registers all over the world.

The software giant came to know about the data breach after its staff discovered malicious code on the MICROS customer support portal and certain legacy MICROS systems. Hackers likely installed malware on the troubleshooting portal in order to capture customers' credentials as they logged in. 

These usernames and passwords can then be used to access their accounts and remotely control their MICROS point-of-sales terminals.

In a brief letter sent to MICROS customers, Oracle told businesses to change their MICROS account passwords for the MICROS online support site ‚Äì particularly passwords that are used by MICROS staff to control on-site payment terminals remotely.

"Oracle Security has detected and addressed malicious code in certain legacy MICROS systems," said the company. "Oracle's Corporate network and other cloud and service offerings were not impacted by this code."¬†

"Payment card data is encrypted both at rest and in transit in the MICROS hosted environment‚Ä¶ Consistent with standard security remediation protocols, Oracle [requires] MICROS customers to change the passwords for all MICROS accounts."
Citing unknown sources, security news site KrebsOnSecurity, reported that the attack possibly came from a Russian crime gang, dubbed Carbanak Gang, that has been accused of stealing more than $1 Billion from banks and retailer stores in past hacks.



The scope of the data breach is still unknown, but anonymous sources familiar with the breach have told Krebs that the hack may have affected up to 700 systems.

Since customers payment data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, Oracle said that this information is not at risk.

Oracle acquired MICROS in 2014 in a $5 Billion acquisition deal. Currently, MICROS devices are deployed at over 330,000 point-of-sale terminals (or cash registers) at food and beverage outlets, retail stores, and hotels across 180 countries.

The software giant is still investigating the security breach at its payment terminal division.

Over the past few years, the security breach has hit POS terminals ‚Äì or "cash registers" ‚Äì operated by a large number of retailers, food chains, hotels, and other types of merchants. Two of the best-known victims to be hit by POS malware are Target and Home Depot.

POS terminals have emerged as the favorite target for cybercriminal gangs because when it comes to the cheap and easy way to siphon the vast number of payment cards, breaching a single retailer's internal network could allow criminals to collect Millions of valid payment card numbers in a relatively short amount of time.

Last year Google employees took an initiative to help thousands of Open Source Projects patch a critical remote code execution vulnerability in a widely used Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library.

Dubbed Operation Rosehub, the initiative was volunteered by some 50 Google employees, who utilized 20 percent of their work time to patch over 2600 open source projects on Github, those were vulnerable to "Mad Gadget vulnerability."

Mad Gadget vulnerability (CVE-2015-6420) is a remote code execution bug in the Java deserialization used by the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a system.

The ACC Library is widely deployed by many Java applications to decode data passed between computers. To exploit this flaw, all an unauthorized attacker need to do is submit maliciously crafted input to an application on a targeted system that uses the ACC library.

Once the vulnerable ACC library on the affected system deserializes the content, the attacker could remotely execute arbitrary code on the compromised system, which could then be used to conduct further attacks.

Remember ransomware attack on Muni Metro System? Late last year, an anonymous hacker managed to infect and take over more than 2,000 computers using this same Mad Gadget flaw in the software used to operate San Francisco's public transport system.

Following the public disclosure of the Mad Gadget flaw, almost every commercial enterprise including<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle,</span> Cisco, Red Hat, VMWare, IBM, Intel, Adobe, HP, Jenkins, and SolarWinds formally disclosed that they had been impacted by this vulnerability and patched it in their software.

However, few months after all big businesses patched the flaw, one of the Google employees noticed that several prominent open source libraries were still depending on the vulnerable versions of ACC library.

"We recognized that the industry best practices had failed. An action was needed to keep the open source community safe. So rather than simply posting a security advisory asking everyone to address the vulnerability, we formed a task force to update their code for them. That initiative was called Operation Rosehub," Justine Tunney, Software Engineer on TensorFlow, wrote on Google Open Source Blog.
Under Operation Rosehub, patches were sent to many open source projects, although the Google employees were only able to patch open source projects on GitHub that directly referenced vulnerable versions of ACC library.

According to the Open Source Blog, if the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency's software systems had been open source, Google engineers would also have been able to deliver patches for Mad Gadget to them, and their systems would have never been compromised.

This newly discovered bugs in Java and Python is a big deal today.

The two popular programming languages, Java and Python, contain similar security flaws that can be exploited to send unauthorized emails and bypass any firewall defenses.

And since both the flaws remain unpatched, hackers can take advantage to design potential cyber attack operations against critical networks and infrastructures.

The unpatched flaws actually reside in the way Java and Python programming languages handle File Transfer Protocol (FTP) links, where they don't syntax-check the username parameter, which leads to, what researchers call, protocol injection flaw.


Java/Python FTP Injection to Send Unauthorized SMTP Emails


In a blog post published over the past week, security researcher Alexander Klink detailed the FTP protocol injection vulnerability in Java's XML eXternal Entity (XXE) that allows attackers to inject non-FTP malicious commands inside an FTP connection request.

To demonstrate the attack, Alexander showed how to send an unauthorized email via SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) in an FTP connection attempt, even though the FTP connection failed, as FTP servers does support authentication, but doesn't check for the present of carriage returns (CR) or line feeds (LF) in usernames.

"This attack is particularly interesting in a scenario where you can reach an (unrestricted, maybe not even spam- or malware-filtering) internal mail server from the machine doing the XML parsing," Alexander concluded.


Java/Python FTP Injections Allow to Bypass Firewall

However, two days later in a separate security advisory, security researcher Timothy Morgan from Blindspot Security came forward with his findings, showing more threatening exploitation scenario where the FTP URL handlers in both Java and Python can be used to bypass firewalls.

Morgan said such FTP protocol injection flaw could be used to trick a victim's firewall into accepting TCP connections from the web to the vulnerable host's system on its "high" ports (from 1024 to 65535).

Besides the FTP protocol injection attack, there's reside a decade old security issue in FTP protocol called classic mode FTP ‚Äì an insecure mechanism of client-server FTP interactions, but many firewall vendors still support it by default.

When a classic mode FTP connection is initiated, the firewall temporarily opens a port ‚Äì typically between 1024 and 65535 ‚Äì specified in the PORT command, which introduces security risks.

Using the FTP protocol injection issue in Java and Python, an attacker who knows the targeted host‚Äôs internal IP address can start a classic mode FTP connection, which attackers can use for nefarious purposes.

Morgan has determined that an attacker can open up one port in the targeted firewall with only three requests:

Identify the victim's internal IP address ‚Äì this requires an attacker to "send an URL, see how the client behaves, then try another until the attack is successful."
Determine packet alignment and ensure that the PORT command is injected at the right moment, making the attack work.
Exploit the vulnerability.


Each additional request can be used to open up another TCP port.


Easily Exploitable Protocol Injection Flaw

However, the researcher warned that his exploit could be used for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, server-side request forgery (SSRF), an XEE attack and more ‚Äì and once bypassed the firewall, desktop hosts can be attacked even if they do not have Java installed.

All an attacker need is to convince victims into accessing a malicious Java or Python applications installed on a server to bypass the entire firewall.

"If a desktop user could be convinced to visit a malicious website while Java is installed, even if Java applets are disabled, they could still trigger Java Web Start to parse a JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol) file," Morgan said. "These files could contain malicious FTP URLs which trigger this bug."

"Also note, that since Java parses JNLP files before presenting the user with any security warnings, the attack can be entirely successful without any indication to the user (unless the browser itself warns the user about Java Web Start being launched)."
According to Morgan, a nearly identical flaw also exists in Python's urllib2 and urllib libraries, although "this injection appears to be limited to attacks via directory names specified in the URL."


Protocol Injection Flaw Is Still Unpatched

Morgan said the FTP protocol injection flaw was reported to the Python team in January 2016 and<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle </span>in November 2016 by his company, but neither of the two has issued any update to address the issue.

Morgan has developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit but is currently holding back publication of his exploit until Oracle and Python respond to the disclosure and release patches.

The Morgan's exploit has successfully been tested against Palo Alto Networks and Cisco ASA firewalls, though researchers believe many commercial firewalls are also vulnerable to FTP stream injection attacks.

So until patches become available, Morgan suggests users uninstall Java on their desktops and in browsers, as well as disable support for "classic mode" FTP on all firewalls.

Do you believe that just because you have downloaded an app from the official app store, you're safe from malware?

Think twice before believing it.

A team of security researchers from several security firms have uncovered a new, widespread botnet that consists of tens of thousands of hacked Android smartphones.

Dubbed WireX, detected as "Android Clicker," the botnet network primarily includes infected Android devices running one of the hundreds of malicious apps installed from Google Play Store and is designed to conduct massive application layer DDoS attacks.

Researchers from different Internet technology and security companies‚Äîwhich includes Akamai, CloudFlare, Flashpoint, Google,<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle </span>Dyn, RiskIQ, Team Cymru‚Äîspotted a series of cyber attacks earlier this month, and they collaborated to combat it.

Although Android malware campaigns are quite common these days and this newly discovered campaign is also not that much sophisticated, I am quite impressed with the way multiple security firms‚Äîwhere half of them are competitors‚Äîcame together and shared information to take down a botnet.


WireX botnet was used to launch minor DDoS attacks earlier this month, but after mid-August, the attacks began to escalate.

The "WireX" botnet had already infected over 120,000 Android smartphones at its peak earlier this month, and on 17th August, researchers noticed a massive DDoS attack (primarily HTTP GET requests) originated from more than 70,000 infected mobile devices from over 100 countries.

If your website has been DDoSed, look for the following pattern of User-Agent strings to check if it was WireX botnet: 


After further investigation, security researchers identified more than 300 malicious apps on Google‚Äôs official Play Store, many of which purported to be media, video players, ringtones, or tools for storage managers and app stores, which include the malicious WireX code.

Just like many malicious apps, WireX apps do not act maliciously immediately after the installation in order to evade detection and make their ways to Google Play Store.

Instead, WireX apps wait patiently for commands from its command and control servers located at multiple subdomains of "axclick.store."

Google has identified and already blocked most of 300 WireX apps, which were mostly downloaded by users in Russia, China, and other Asian countries, although the WireX botnet is still active on a small scale.


If your device is running a newer version of the Android operating system that includes Google's Play Protect feature, the company will automatically remove WireX apps from your device, if you have one installed.

Play Protect is Google's newly launched security feature that uses machine learning and app usage analysis to remove (uninstall) malicious apps from users Android smartphones to prevent further harm.

Also, it is highly recommended to install apps from reputed and verified developers, even when downloading from Google official Play Store and avoid installing unnecessary apps.

Additionally, you are strongly advised to always keep a good antivirus app on your mobile device that can detect and block malicious apps before they can infect your device, and always keep your device and apps up-to-date.

Android malware continues to evolve with more sophisticated and never-seen-before attack vectors and capabilities with every passing day.

Just at the beginning of this week, Google removed over 500 Android apps utilising the rogue SDK‚Äîthat secretly distribute spyware to users‚Äîfrom its Play Store marketplace.

Last month, we also saw first Android malware with code injecting capabilities making rounds on Google Play Store.

A few days after that, researchers discovered another malicious Android SDK ads library, dubbed "Xavier," found installed on more than 800 different apps that had been downloaded millions of times from Google Play Store.

Two critical zero-day vulnerabilities have been discovered in the world's 2nd most popular database management software MySQL that could allow an attacker to take full control over the database.

Polish security researcher Dawid Golunski has discovered two zero-days, CVE-2016-6662 and CVE-2016-6663, that affect all currently supported MySQL versions as well as its forked such as MariaDB and PerconaDB.

Golunski further went on to publish details and a proof-of-concept exploit code for CVE-2016-6662 after informing<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle </span>of both issues, along with vendors of MariaDB and PerconaDB.

Both MariaDB and PerconaDB had fixed the vulnerabilities, but Oracle had not.

The vulnerability (CVE-2016-6662) can be exploited by hackers to inject malicious settings into MySQL configuration files or create their own malicious ones.


Exploitation Vector

The above flaw could be exploited either via SQL Injection or by hackers with authenticated access to MySQL database (via a network connection or web interfaces like phpMyAdmin).

"A successful exploitation [of CVE-2016-6662] could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges which would then allow them to fully compromise the server on which an affected version of MySQL is running," Golunski explained in an advisory published today.
This could result in complete compromise of the server running the affected MySQL version.

The researcher also warned that the vulnerability could be exploited even if SELinux or AppArmor Linux kernel security module is enabled with default active policies for MySQL service on the major Linux distributions.

The flaw actually resides in the mysqld_safe script that is used as a wrapper by many MySQL default packages or installations to start the MySQL service process.

The mysqld_safe wrapper script is executed as root, and the primary mysqld process drops its privilege level to MySQL user, Golunski examined.

"If an attacker managed to inject a path to their malicious library within the config, they would be able to preload an arbitrary library and thus execute arbitrary code with root privileges when MySQL service is restarted (manually, via a system update, package update, system reboot, etc.)"
The researcher will soon release details and full exploit code for CVE-2016-6663, the flaw that allows low-privileged attackers to make exploitation trivial.


No MySQL Patch Available Yet


Golunski reported the zero-day flaws to Oracle on July 29 and other affected vendors on July 29.

While Oracle acknowledged and triaged the report, scheduling the next Oracle CPUs for October 18, 2016, MariaDB and PerconaDB patched their versions of the database software before the end of August.

Since more than 40 days have passed and the two vendors released the patches to fix the issues, Golunski said he decided to go public with the details of the zero-days.


Temporary Mitigation:

Until Oracle fixes the problem in its next CPU, you can implement some temporary mitigations, proposed by the researcher, for protecting your servers.

"As temporary mitigations, users should ensure that no MySQL config files are owned by the mysql user, and create root-owned dummy my.cnf files that are not in use," Golunski wrote.¬†
But remember, the above mitigations are just workarounds, so you are advised to apply vendor patches as soon as they become available.

Researchers have designed a new computer chip that promises to boost the performance of computers and data centers while processing applications in parallel.

Princeton University researchers have developed a 25-core open source processor, dubbed Piton named after the metal spikes used by rock climbers, which has been designed to be flexible, highly scalable, fast and energy-efficient to satisfy the demands of massive-scale data centers.

Every computer has a processor, but it's the core, a processing unit, which defines its actual efficiency and performance.

A Processor can have a single core or multiple cores, which receive instructions, then performs calculations on it based on those instructions, and gives the results back.

For example, the four independent processing units i.e. Cores of a quad-core processor can run multiple instructions at the same time, increasing the overall performance for applications compatible with parallel processing.


Your Future Desktop could be a Supercomputer

However, researchers aim is to design a chip that could be used specifically for massive computing systems in large data centers that handle cloud services, email services, search and social networking requests.

With Piton, researchers believe that they can create a giant 200,000-core computer stuffed with 8,000 64-bit Piton chips, ensuring the massive collection of cores are in sync when processing different applications in parallel.






Piton is an open-source processor based on OpenSparc, which is a modified version of<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle'</span>s OpenSparc T1 processor. The current version of the Piton chip measures 6mmx6mm with over 460 Million transistors (each 32nm), making Piton the largest chip developed by academia in size.

"The chip we've made is among the largest ever built in academia and it shows how servers could run far more efficiently and cheaply," said David Wentzlaff, a Princeton University assistant professor of electrical engineering and faculty in the Department of Computer Science.

Some of Piton's features are listed below:

25 modified OpenSPARC T1 cores
Directory-based shared memory
3 On-chip networks
Multi-chip shared memory support
1 GHz clock frequency
IBM 32nm SOI process (6mm X 6mm)
460 Million transistors

We have seen a large number of chips with many dozens of cores developed in recent years. In 2011, researchers from University of Glasgow had created an ultra-fast 1,000-core computer processor.

Also, IBM unveiled neuromorphic computing-based "TrueNorth" in 2014, which is a 4,096 cores brain-like processor chip designed to mimic the human brain for real-time power efficiency.

However, the readily scalable design of Piton can allow thousands of cores on a single chip with half a Billion cores in the data center, and more cores mean more processing power.

Another innovation by the researchers is a 'Memory-Traffic Shaper' that acts as a mediator between the demands of different apps accessing memory on the chip and waving them properly, so they do not block the system. 

Video Demonstration:


This approach, researchers claimed, can yield an 18% increase in performance compared to conventional means of memory allocation.

Piton is yet a prototype for future commercial server systems that possibly can take advantage of a huge number of cores to speed up processing.

Details about Piton were presented at the Hot Chips: A Symposium on High-Performance Chips conference in Cupertino this week and the Princeton researchers have made the design open source, making it available to the public and fellow researchers.

Researchers have uncovered a Chinese cyber-espionage against the United States ahead of the trade summit on Thursday between US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping.

According to a new report published today by Fidelis Cybersecurity firm, the Chinese APT10 hacking group implanted a piece of malware on the "Events" page of the US National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) website in February.

Dubbed 'Operation TradeSecret,' the attack against the NFTC site is seen as an attempt to conduct surveillance on the main industry players and lobbyists closely associated with U.S trade policy activities. 

Researchers say hackers placed a malicious link on the NFTC website, inviting the organization's board of directors to register for a meeting in Washington DC on March 7. But clicking on the link deployed a spying tool called "Scanbox."

Dates back to 2014, Scanbox ‚Äì previously used by nation-state threat actors associated with the Chinese government ‚Äì has the ability to record the type and versions of software a victim is running and run keyloggers on compromised computers, said Fidelis researcher John Bambenek.

"This attack was really at its core a reconnaissance attack. Anyone who visited this calendar entry would expose their software versions and use a JavaScript keylogger that could expose their identity," said Bambenek.

"Traditionally these attacks are used to precisely identify targets and help them craft targeted phishing attacks using exploits they know the victim is vulnerable to."
The malicious link was active on the NFTC website between February 27 and March 1. The malware was already removed from the site by the time Fidelis contacted NFTC.

The NFTC's staff and board represent many influential people and companies -- from President Rufus Yerxa, the U.S. Ambassador to GATT to executives from major companies including Google, Amazon, eBay, IBM, Coca-Cola, Microsoft,<span class="highlight-match"> Oracle,</span> Cisco, KPMG, Pfizer, Visa, Ford, Halliburton, and Walmart.

Although Fidelis detected no further attacks on NFTC board members, the security firm believed the hackers were after a full range of entities relevant to the trade negotiations due to take place Thursday between US and China.

This is the second time in a week when APT10 cyber espionage campaign has come to light. A report released this week by BAE Systems, and PwC also claimed that APT10 was targeting managed IT services providers (MSPs) and their customers across the globe to steal sensitive data.

Besides a previously undisclosed code-execution flaw in Microsoft Word, the tech giant patches two more zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers had been exploiting in the wild for months, as part of this month's Patch Tuesday.

In total, Microsoft patches 45 unique vulnerabilities in its nine products, including three previously undisclosed vulnerabilities under active attack.

The first vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) under attack is a remote-code execution flaw that could allow an attacker to remotely take over a fully patched and up to date computer when the victim opens a Word document containing a booby-trapped OLE2link object.

The attack can bypass most exploit mitigations developed by Microsoft, and according to Ryan Hanson of security firm Optiv, in some cases, exploits can execute malicious code even when Protected View is enabled.

As The Hacker News reported Monday, this code-execution flaw in Microsoft Word was being exploited by hackers to spread a version of infamous Dridex banking trojan. 

Also, according to blog posts published Tuesday by security firms<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye </span>and Netskope, hackers are exploiting the same Word vulnerability to install Latentbot and Godzilla malware respectively.

Microsoft has released a fix for CVE-2017-0199 and credited Hanson with responsible reporting the critical vulnerability to the company.


Patch for Critical IE Flaw Being Exploited in the Wild

The company also pushed out a patch for another critical vulnerability (CVE-2017-0210) under active attack. The flaw is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Internet Explorer that would allow an attacker to trick a victim into visiting a compromised website.

The vulnerability could allow the attacker to access sensitive information from one domain and inject it into another domain.

"The vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, the vulnerability could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (for example, a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code," Microsoft's guidance for the flaw reads.
This IE vulnerability is also being exploited in the wild.


Another Critical Word Vulnerability Yet Unpatched!

The third previously undisclosed flaw (CVE-2017-2605) resides in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) filter in Microsoft Office, but Microsoft did not actually release an update for this flaw in Tuesday's update batch.

However, the tech giant issued an update for Microsoft Office that, by default, disable the EPS filter in MS Office as a defense measure. This Word vulnerability is also being exploited in the wild when a target opens a malicious EPS image in Word.

"Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks that could leverage an unpatched vulnerability in the EPS filter and is taking this action to help reduce customer risk until the security update is released," the guidance for the flaw reads.
The company also issued a patch for Windows 10 Creators Update, which was made available on Tuesday, addressing some remote code execution flaws and elevation of privilege bugs.

In total, Microsoft rolled out 15 security updates on Tuesday patching dozens of unique CVEs in its products, including the Windows OS, Exchange Server, Edge and Internet Explorer, Office, Office Services and Office Web Apps, Visual Studio for Mac Silverlight and Adobe Flash.

Users are strongly advised to install updates as soon as possible in order to protect themselves against the active attacks in the wild on three separate Microsoft products.

Reportedly, at least one senior cyber security analyst working with Mandiant, a Virginia-based cybersecurity firm owned by the<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye,</span> appears to have had its system compromised by hackers, exposing his sensitive information on the Internet.

On Sunday, an anonymous group of hackers posted some sensitive details allegedly belonged to Adi Peretz, a ‚ÄéSenior Threat Intelligence Analyst at Mandiant, claiming they have had complete access to the company's internal networks since 2016.

The recent hack into Mandiant has been dubbed Operation #LeakTheAnalyst.


Further Leaks from Mandiant Might Appear


The hackers have leaked nearly 32 megabytes of data‚Äîboth personal and professional‚Äîbelonging to Peretz on Pastebin as proof, which suggests they have more Mandiant data that could be leaked in upcoming days.

"It was fun to be inside a giant company named ‚ÄúMandiant‚Äù we enjoyed watching how they try to protect their clients and how their dumb analysts are trying to reverse engineer malware and stuff," the Pastebin post reads.¬†

"This leak was just a glimpse of how deep we breached into Mandiant, we might publish more critical data in the future."

Hackers dumped a treasure trove of sensitive information, which includes:


Peretz's Microsoft account login details
Peretz's Contacts
Screenshots of the Windows Find My Device Geolocator, linked to Peretz's Surface Pro laptop.
Client correspondence
Presentations
Contents of his email inbox
Several internal Mandiant and FireEye documents
Threat intelligence profiles for the Israeli Defence Force (IDF)

Besides leaks, the anonymous hackers also reportedly broke into Peretz's LinkedIn page and defaced it. His profile has since been deleted from the professional media network.

Although the motives behind the hack are not known at this moment, Mandiant has yet to comment on the incident.

In response to the leak, Mandiant's parent company,¬†FireEye issued a statement, blaming the employee's social media accounts for the leak. The statement reads:

We are aware of reports that a Mandiant employee's social media accounts were compromised. We immediately began investigating this situation, and took steps to limit further exposure. Our investigation continues, but thus far, we have found no evidence FireEye or Mandiant systems were compromised.

As part of this month's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has released security patches for a total of 55 vulnerabilities across its products, including fixes for four zero-day vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.

Just yesterday, Microsoft released an emergency out-of-band update separately to patch a remote execution bug (CVE-2017-0290) in Microsoft's Antivirus Engine that comes enabled by default on Windows 7, 8.1, RT, 10 and Server 2016 operating systems.

The vulnerability, reported by Google Project Zero researchers, could allow an attacker to take over your Windows PC with just an email, which you haven't even opened yet.

May 2017 Patch Tuesday ‚Äî Out of 55 vulnerabilities, 17 have been rated as critical and affect the company's main operating systems, along with other products like Office, Edge, Internet Explorer, and the malware protection engine used in most of the Microsoft's anti-malware products.

Sysadmins all over the world should prioritize the May's Patch Tuesday as it addresses four critical zero-day vulnerabilities, three of which being actively exploited by cyber-espionage groups in targeted attacks over the past few months.


3 Zero-Days Were Exploited in the Wild by Russian Cyber-Espionage Group

First Zero-Day Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0261) ‚Äî It affects the 32- and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office 2010, 2013 and 2016, and resides in how Office handles Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) image files, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the system.

This Office vulnerability could be exploited by tricking victims into opening a file containing a malformed graphics image in an email. The attack also exploits a Windows privilege escalation bug (CVE-2017-0001) that the company patched on March 14 to gain full control over the system ‚Äì essentially allowing attackers to install spyware and other malware.

According to the<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye </span>researchers, the CVE-2017-0261 flaw has been exploited since late March by an unknown group of financially motivated hackers and by a Russian cyber espionage group called Turla, also known as Snake or Uroburos.

Second Zero-Day Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0262) ‚Äî FireEye and ESET researchers believe that the APT28 hacking group, also known as Fancy Bear, or Pawn Storm, was actively using this EPS-related Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability which leads to remote code execution on opening a malformed file.

Third Zero-Day Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0263) ‚Äî The third zero-day bug is an elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability in all supported versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system.

This vulnerability exists in the way Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code in kernel mode and then install malware, view, change, or delete data, and even create new accounts with full user rights.

Researchers believe that the Russian cyber-espionage group was also actively exploiting this flaw (CVE-2017-0263) along with the second zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2017-0262).

Fourth Zero-Day Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0222) ‚Äî Another zero-day vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 10 and 11 and resides in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

Opening a malicious web page can corrupt memory to trigger remote code execution, allowing attackers to take control of an affected system. According to the tech giant, this issue was also exploited in the wild.

Patches for Other Critical Vulnerabilities ‚Äî This month's security updates also fix critical vulnerabilities in both Edge and Internet Explorer (IE) that could lead to remote code execution by tricking victims into visiting malicious websites or viewing specially crafted advertisements inside the browsers.

Besides this, Microsoft also addresses four critical remote code execution bugs (CVE-2017-0272, CVE-2017-0277, CVE-2017-0278, and CVE-2017-0279) in Windows SMB network file-sharing protocol, which affects Windows 7 through 10 and Windows Server 2008 through 2016.

These vulnerabilities put Windows PCs and server installations at risk of hacking if they use SMBv1, though there have been no reports of any of these flaws exploited in the wild.

As usual, Adobe Flash Players patches are also included in the security update to address 7 CVE-listed flaws in the Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Windows users are strongly advised to install the latest updates as soon as possible in order to protect themselves against the active attacks in the wild.

Security researchers have recently uncovered a cyber espionage group targeting aerospace, defence and energy organisations in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.

According to the latest research published Wednesday by US security firm<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye,</span> an Iranian hacking group that it calls Advanced Persistent Threat 33 (or APT33) has been targeting critical infrastructure, energy and military sectors since at least 2013 as part of a massive cyber-espionage operation to gather intelligence and steal trade secrets.

The security firm also says it has evidence that APT33 works on behalf of Iran's government.

FireEye researchers have spotted cyber attacks aimed by APT33 since at least May 2016 and found that the group has successfully targeted aviation sector‚Äîboth military and commercial‚Äîas well as organisations in the energy sector with a link to petrochemical.

The APT33 victims include a U.S. firm in the aerospace sector, a Saudi Arabian business conglomerate with aviation holdings, and a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals.

Most recently, in May 2017, APT33 targeted employees of a Saudi organisation and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice them with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company.

"We believe the targeting of the Saudi organisation may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea‚Äôs recent partnerships with Iran‚Äôs petrochemical industry as well as South Korea‚Äôs relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies," the FireEye report reads.

APT33 targets organisations by sending spear phishing emails with malicious HTML links to infect targets' computers with malware. The malware used by the espionage group includes DROPSHOT (dropper), SHAPESHIFT (wiper) and TURNEDUP (custom backdoor, which is the final payload).

However, in previous research published by Kaspersky, DROPSHOT was tracked by its researchers as StoneDrill, which targeted petroleum company in Europe and believed to be an updated version of Shamoon 2 malware.


"Although we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP backdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT," the report reads.

The SHAPESHIFT malware can wipe disks, erase volumes and delete files, depending on its configuration.

According to FireEye, APT 33 sent hundreds of spear phishing emails last year from several domains, which masqueraded as Saudi aviation companies and international organisations, including Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia.

The security firm also believes APT 33 is linked to Nasr Institute, an Iranian government organisation that conducts cyber warfare operations.

In July, researchers at Trend Micro and Israeli firm ClearSky uncovered another Iranian espionage group, dubbed Rocket Kittens, that was also active since 2013 and targeted organisations and individuals, including diplomats and researchers, in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and Germany.

However, FireEye report does not show any links between both the hacking group. For more technical details about the APT33 operations, you can head on to FireEye's official blog post.

If you are a regular reader of The Hacker News, you might be aware of an ongoing cyber attack ‚Äî detected in the wild by McAfee and<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye </span>‚Äî that silently installs malware on fully-patched computers by exploiting an unpatched Microsoft Word vulnerability in all current versions of Microsoft Office.

Now, according to security firm Proofpoint, the operators of the Dridex malware started exploiting the unpatched Microsoft Word vulnerability to spread a version of their infamous Dridex banking trojan.

Dridex is currently one of the most dangerous banking trojans on the Internet that exhibits the typical behavior of monitoring a victim's traffic to bank sites by infiltrating PCs and stealing victim's online banking credentials and financial data.

The Dridex actors usually relied on macro-laden Word files to distribute the malware through spam messages or emails.

However, this is the first time when researchers found the Dridex operators using an unpatched zero-day flaw in Microsoft Word for distributing their banking trojan.



According to a blog post published Monday night by Proofpoint, the latest Dridex spam campaign is delivering Word documents weaponized with this zero-day to millions of recipients across several organizations, including banks primarily located in Australia.

"Emails in this campaign used an attached Microsoft Word RTF (Rich Text Format) document. Messages purported to be from "[device]@[recipient's domain]." [Device] may be "copier", "documents", "noreply", "no-reply", or "scanner"," Proofpoint researchers say.¬†


"The subject line in all cases read "Scan Data" and included attachments named "Scan_123456.doc" or "Scan_123456.pdf", where "123456" was replaced with random digits...the spoofed email domains and the common practice of emailing digitized versions of documents make the lures fairly convincing."
As we reported on Saturday, this zero-day flaw is severe because it gives hackers power to bypass most exploit mitigations developed by Microsoft, and unlike past Word exploits seen in the wild, it doesn't require victims to enable Macros.

Moreover, given the danger of Dridex ‚Äì also known as Bugat and Cridex ‚Äì banking trojan, people are strongly advised not to open Word documents attached to an email from anyone, even if you know the sender until Microsoft releases a patch.


Microsoft knew of the flaw very long ago

According to researchers at McAfee and FireEye, Microsoft has known of the remote code flaw since January and could release a patch for the vulnerability today, as part of its regular Patch Tuesday routine.

However, an independent security researcher Ryan Hanson claimed that he discovered this 0-day, along with the two other flaws, in July and reported it to Microsoft in October 2016.

"The initial discovery was in July, which was followed up by additional research and the identification of a protected view bypass vulnerability. Those two bugs and an additional Outlook bug were submitted to MS in October," Hanson told The Hacker News.¬†

"There may very well be additional HTA related vectors in Office, but based on the detail provided by McAfee, the vulnerability they've identified functions exactly like the one I disclosed. The only difference I see is the VBScript payload, since my payload simply executed calc.exe."
If the claims made by Hanson is true and his reported vulnerability is the same being used in the wild to spread Dridex, Microsoft left its customers vulnerable to the attacks even after being known of the critical flaw for quite long.


Enable 'Protected View' in Microsoft Office to Prevent Attack

Since the attack does not work when a malicious document is viewed in Office Protected View, users are advised to enable this feature in order to view any Office documents.

Equifax data breach was bigger than initially reported, exposing highly sensitive information of more Americans than previously revealed.

Credit rating agency Equifax says an additional 2.5 million U.S. consumers were also impacted by the massive data breach the company disclosed last month, bringing the total possible victims to 145.5 million from 143 million.

Equifax last month announced that it had suffered a massive data breach that exposed highly sensitive data of hundreds of millions of its customers, which includes names, social security numbers, dates of birth and addresses.

In addition, credit card information for nearly 209,000 customers was also stolen, as well as certain documents with personally identifying information (PII) for approximately 182,000 Equifax consumers.

The breach was due to a critical vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) in Apache Struts 2 framework, which Apache patched over two months earlier (on March 6) of the security incident.

Equifax was even informed by the US-CERT on March 8 to patch the flaw, but the company failed to identified or patched its systems against the issue, Equifax ex-CEO Richard Smith said in a statement [PDF] to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.

"It appears that the breach occurred because of both human error and technology failures," Smith said. "Equifax's information security department also ran scans that should have identified any systems that were vulnerable to the Apache Struts issue...Unfortunately, however, the scans did not identify the Apache Struts vulnerability."
In the wake of the security incident, the company hired<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye-</span>owned security firm Mandiant to investigate the breach, which has now concluded the forensic portion of its investigation and plans to release the results "promptly."

Mandiant said a total of 145.5 million consumers might now potentially have been impacted by the breach, which is 2.5 million more than previously estimated. However, the firm did not identify any evidence of "new attacker activity."

"Mandiant did not identify any evidence of additional or new attacker activity or any access to new databases or tables," Equifax said in a Monday press release.¬†

"Instead, this additional population of consumers was confirmed during Mandiant's completion of the remaining investigative tasks and quality assurance procedures built into the investigative process."
The forensic investigation also found that approximately 8,000 Canadian consumers were also impacted, which is much lower than the 100,000 initially estimated figure by the credit rating and reporting firm.

However, Equifax said that this figure "was preliminary and did not materialize."

"I want to apologize again to all impacted consumers. As this important phase of our work is now completed, we continue to take numerous steps to review and enhance our cybersecurity practices," newly appointed interim CEO, Paulino do Rego Barros, Jr. said.

"We also continue to work closely with our internal team and outside advisors to implement and accelerate long-term security improvements."

Equifax, which maintains data on over 820 million consumers and over 91 million businesses worldwide, also said the company would update its own notification by October 8 for its customers who want to check if they were among those affected by the data breach.

Indian embassy websites in seven different countries have been hacked, and attackers have leaked personal data, including full name, residential address, email address, passport number and phone number, of Indian citizens living abroad.

This incident is extremely worrying because it involves diplomatic personnel working in the embassies that have always been a favorite target of state-sponsored hackers launching cyber espionage campaigns.

Security pen-testers who go by the name Kapustkiy and Kasimierz have claimed responsibility for the hack and told The Hacker News that the reason behind the hack was to force administrators to consider the cyber security of their websites seriously.

In Pastebin link shared on their Twitter account, the hackers claimed to have hijacked Indian Embassy websites in Switzerland, Italy, Romania, Mali, South Africa, Libya, and Malawi and leaked personal details of hundreds of Indians, including students studying abroad.

The pair exploited a simple vulnerability in the targeted websites in an effort to gain unauthorized access to the databases.

The Hacker News team has analyzed those hacked sites and found they are vulnerable to SQL Injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL commands (payloads) to the web application and steal database containing sensitive information.

"We did it because their security was poor, and several domains related to the Indian Embassy had the same vulnerability. This proves that a lot of people can not trust the "Embassy." We hope that this problem will be fixed in the future." hackers told The Hacker News via email.

"We did not do it for the lulz or something, but we did just for them to pay attention to the issues with their crucial websites. Also, we did not leak anything like their real address, city or zip code, which is available in the database."¬†
The leaked data shows that the targeted websites are so insecure that even user and admin passwords are also stored in plaintext without any hashing mechanism.


Is India Prepared for Cyber Attacks?


This is not just the first time when hackers have targeted Indian embassies. In the month of June, seven other High Commission websites in Tajikistan, Romania, Greece, Turkey, Mexico, Sao Paolo and Pretoria were hacked and defaced by Pakistani hackers.

However, it seems like the Indian government did not take the incident as a lesson to tighten the security of its critical infrastructure that is all time favorite target of black hat and nation-state actors and could put nation‚Äôs security at risk.

Since past two and a half years, from when Narender Modi has come into power as Prime Minister, we have heard so much about Digital India Programme ‚Äì an initiative championed by Government of India that aims at making all government services electronically available as well as providing high-speed Internet connectivity nationwide.

The Department of Telecommunications has stated multiple times that the Indian government is very serious about the cyber security threats and is taking all the necessary initiatives in this direction.

The initiative also includes vision to broaden digital infrastructure in the country with new technologies, but so far we have not seen any ground level initiative to tighten up the security of at least websites that represent various crucial government departments, agencies, services, and programs.

Not convinced yet? Let me put some stats to make my point clear.

A report from cyber security company<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye </span>found that 38% of organizations in India were exposed to targeted advanced persistent attacks in the first half of 2015, that's 23% increase from the previous report.

"India is fast becoming a strategic target, in part because of the potentially sensitive information that is expected to be digitized through ambitious and high-profile projects such as Digital India," the report stated.
Last year, an annual report from CERT-In noted that over 26,244 India websites were hacked, which includes hundreds of government websites.

Also, more than 35 Indian central and state government websites have recently been hacked by Pakistani hackers after India did surgical strikes across the Line of Control (LoC), Economic Times reports.

Another survey says that cyber crime incidences in India have drastically jumped in past year, with 72% companies in the country falling victim to online attacks.

So far we haven't completely tackled security of our websites and a stream of Internet of Things (IoT) cyber attacks have dramatically increased the threat landscape in past few months only, which should be addressed immediately.

Get ready to install a fairly large batch of security patches onto your Windows computers.

As part of its September Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has released a large batch of security updates to patch a total of 81 CVE-listed vulnerabilities, on all supported versions of Windows and other MS products.

The latest security update addresses 27 critical and 54 important vulnerabilities in severity, of which 38 vulnerabilities are impacting Windows, 39 could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

Affected Microsoft products include:


Internet Explorer
Microsoft Edge
Microsoft Windows
.NET Framework
Skype for Business and Lync
Microsoft Exchange Server
Microsoft Office, Services and Web Apps
Adobe Flash Player




.NET 0-Day Flaw Under Active Attack

According to the company, four of the patched vulnerabilities are publicly known, one of which has already been actively exploited by the attackers in the wild.

Here's the list of publically known flaws and their impact:

Windows .NET Framework RCE (CVE-2017-8759)‚ÄîA zero-day flaw, discovered by researchers at cybersecurity firm<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye </span>and privately reported it to Microsoft, resides in the way Microsoft .NET Framework processes untrusted input data.

Microsoft says the flaw could allow an attacker to take control of an affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data by tricking victims into opening a specially crafted document or application sent over an email.

The flaw could even allow an attacker to create new accounts with full user rights. Therefore users with fewer user rights on the system are less impacted than users who operate with admin rights.

According to FireEye, this zero-day flaw has actively been exploited by a well-funded cyber espionage group to deliver FinFisher Spyware (FinSpy) to a Russian-speaking "entity" via malicious Microsoft Office RTF files in July this year.

FinSpy is a highly secret surveillance software that has previously been associated with British company Gamma Group, a company that legally sells surveillance and espionage software to government agencies.

Once infected, FinSpy can perform a large number of secret tasks on victims computer, including secretly monitoring computers by turning ON webcams, recording everything the user types with a keylogger, intercepting Skype calls, copying files, and much more.

"The [new variant of FINSPY]...leverages heavily obfuscated code that employs a built-in virtual machine ‚Äì among other anti-analysis techniques ‚Äì to make reversing more difficult," researchers at FireEye said.

"As likely another unique anti-analysis technique, it parses its own full path and searches for the string representation of its own MD5 hash. Many resources, such as analysis tools and sandboxes, rename files/samples to their MD5 hash in order to ensure unique filenames."


Three Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities

The remaining three publicly known vulnerabilities affecting the Windows 10 platform include:


Device Guard Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2017-8746): This flaw could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a Windows PowerShell session by bypassing the Device Guard Code Integrity policy.
Microsoft Edge Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-2017-8723): This flaw resides in Edge where the Content Security Policy (CSP) fails to properly validate certain specially crafted documents, allowing attackers to trick users into visiting a website hosting malware.
Broadcom BCM43xx Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-9417): this flaw exists in the Broadcom chipset in HoloLens, which could be exploited by attackers to send a specially crafted WiFi packet, enabling them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, even create new accounts with full admin rights.



BlueBorne Attack: Another Reason to Install Patches Immediately

Also, the recently disclosed Bluetooth vulnerabilities known as "BlueBorne" (that affected more than 5 Million Bluetooth-enabled devices, including Windows, was silently patched by Microsoft in July, but details of this flaw have only been released now.

BlueBorne is a series of flaws in the implementation of Bluetooth that could allow attackers to take over Bluetooth-enabled devices, spread malware completely, or even establish a "man-in-the-middle" connection to gain access to devices' critical data and networks without requiring any victim interaction.

So, users have another important reason to apply September security patches as soon as possible in order to keep hackers and cyber criminals away from taking control over their computers.

Other flaws patched this month include five information disclosure and one denial of service flaws in Windows Hyper-V, two cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws in SharePoint, as well as four memory corruption and two remote code execution vulnerabilities in MS Office.

For installing security updates, simply head on to Settings ‚Üí Update & security ‚Üí Windows Update ‚Üí Check for updates, or you can install the updates manually.

An infamous Russian-linked cyber-espionage group has been found re-using the same leaked NSA hacking tool that was deployed in the WannaCry and NotPetya outbreaks‚Äîthis time to target Wi-Fi networks to spy on hotel guests in several European countries.

Security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye </span>have uncovered an ongoing campaign that remotely steals credentials from high-value guests using Wi-Fi networks at European hotels and attributed it to the Fancy Bear hacking group.

Fancy Bear‚Äîalso known as APT28, Sofacy, Sednit, and Pawn Storm‚Äîhas been operating since at least 2007 and also been accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton Campaign in an attempt to influence the U.S. presidential election.

The newly-discovered campaign is also exploiting the Windows SMB exploit (CVE-2017-0143), called EternalBlue, which was one of many exploits allegedly used by the NSA for surveillance and leaked by the Shadow Brokers in April.

EternalBlue is a security vulnerability which leverages a version of Windows' Server Message Block (SMB) version 1 networking protocol to laterally spread across networks and also allowed the WannaCry and Petya ransomware to spread across the world quickly.

Since the EternalBlue code is available for anyone to use, cyber criminals are widely trying to use the exploit to make their malware more powerful.

Just last week, a new version of credential stealing TrickBot banking Trojan was found leveraging SMB to spread locally across networks, though the trojan was not leveraging EternalBlue at that time.

However, researchers have now found someone deploying the exploit to upgrade their attack.

"To spread through the hospitality company's network, APT28 used a version of the EternalBlue SMB exploit," FireEye researchers write. "This is the first time we have seen APT28 incorporate this exploit into their intrusions."
Researchers have seen ongoing attacks targeting a number of companies in the hospitality sector, including hotels in at least seven countries in Europe and one Middle Eastern country.


Here's How the Attack is Carried Out

The attacks began with a spear phishing email sent to one of the hotel employees. The email contains a malicious document named "Hotel_Reservation_Form.doc," which uses macros to decode and deploy GameFish, malware known to be used by Fancy Bear.

Once installed on the targeted hotel's network, GameFish uses the EternalBlue SMB exploit to laterally spread across the hotel network and find systems that control both guest and internal Wi-Fi networks.

Once under control, the malware deploys Responder, an open source penetration testing tool created by Laurent Gaffie of SpiderLabs, for NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning in order to steal credentials sent over the wireless network.

While the hacking group carried out the attack against the hotel network, researchers believe that the group could also directly target "hotel guests of interest"‚Äîgenerally business and government personnel who travel in a foreign country.

The researchers revealed one such incident that occurred in 2016 where Fancy Bear accessed the computer and Outlook Web Access (OWA) account of a guest staying at a hotel in Europe, 12 hours after victim connected to the hotel‚Äôs Wi-Fi network.

This is not the only attack that apparently aimed at guests of hotels. South Korea-nexus Fallout Team (also known as DarkHotel) has previously carried out such attacks against Asian hotels to steal information from senior executives from large global companies during their business trips.

Duqu 2.0 malware also found targeting the WiFi networks of European hotels used by participants in the Iranian nuclear negotiations. Also, high-profile people visiting Russia and China may have their laptops and other electronic devices accessed.

The easiest way to protect yourself is to avoid connecting to hotel Wi-Fi networks or any other public or untrusted networks, and instead, use your mobile device hotspot to get access to the Internet.

It's ironic‚Äîthe company that offers credit monitoring and ID theft protection solutions has itself been compromised, exposing personal information of as many as 143 million Americans‚Äîthat's almost half the country.

Equifax, one of the three largest credit reporting firm in the United States, admitted today that it had suffered a massive data breach somewhere between mid-May and July this year, which it actually discovered on July 29‚Äîthat means the data of 143 million people were exposed for over 3 months.



However, it's unknown why Equifax waited 6 weeks before informing their millions of affected customers about the massive security breach.


Based on Equifax's investigation, unknown hackers exploited a security vulnerability on its website to gain unauthorized access to certain files.

Stolen data includes consumers' names, Social Security numbers, and birth dates for 143 million Americans, and in some instances, driving licence numbers and credit card numbers for about 209,000 citizens.

The company said that some personal information for Canadian and British residents was also compromised.

Moreover, reportedly, three senior executives at Equifax, namely John Gamble (CFO), Joseph Loughran and Rodolfo Ploder,¬†sold almost $2 million worth of their shares just days after the company learned of this massive hack.

Equifax is currently investigating the security incident and has reportedly hired<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye'</span>s security firm Mandiant to help the company in hack aftermath.

Meanwhile, all Equifax customers are advised to visit http://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com website to check if their information has also been stolen. Users¬†just need to¬†enter the¬†last 6 digits of their SSN and last name.

However, it is not that simple. The website is not giving a clear answer about whether or not your data may have been affected in the hack, but making it clear to those who were not exposed. Yes, it's confusing.

Equifax is asking affected customers to sign up for credit-monitoring and identity theft protection services‚Äîisn't this funny?

Don't worry; it's free for affected users.

The company has not yet confirmed whether the hackers have contacted it for any extortion demand, but since the breach is major, Americans quickly need to take necessary actions to protect themselves and their loved ones.

It seems sophisticated hackers have changed the way they conduct targeted cyber operations‚Äîinstead of investing in zero-days and developing their malware; some hacking groups have now started using ready-made malware just like script kiddies.

Possibly, this could be a smart move for state-sponsored hackers to avoid being attributed easily.

Security researchers from multiple security firms, including Arbor Networks and<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye,</span> independently discovered a series of malware campaigns primarily targeting aerospace, defence contractors and manufacturing sectors in various countries, including the United States, Thailand, South Korea and India.

What's common? All these attack campaigns, conducted by various hacking groups, eventually install same information and password stealer malware‚Äîdubbed FormBook‚Äîon the targeted systems.

FormBook is nothing but a "malware-as-as-service," which is an affordable piece of data-stealing and form-grabbing malware that has been advertised in various hacking forums since early 2016.

Anyone can rent FormBook for just $29 per week or $59 per month, which offers a range of advanced spying capabilities on target machines, including a keylogger, password stealer, network sniffer, taking the screenshots, web form data stealer and more.

According to the researchers, attackers in each campaign are primarily using emails to distribute the FormBook malware as an attachment in different forms, including PDFs with malicious download links, DOC and XLS files with malicious macros, and archive files (ZIP, RAR, ACE, and ISOs) containing EXE payloads.



Once installed on a target system, the malware injects itself into various processes and starts capturing keystrokes and extracts stored passwords and other sensitive data from multiple applications, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Skype, Safari, Vivaldi, Q-360, Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, 3D-FTP, FileZilla and WinSCP.

FormBook continuously sends all the stolen data to a remote command and control (C2) server which also allows the attacker to execute other commands on the targeted system, including start processes, shutdown and reboot the system, and stealing cookies.

"One of the malware's most interesting features is that it reads Windows‚Äô ntdll.dll module from disk into memory, and calls its exported functions directly, rendering user-mode hooking and API monitoring mechanisms ineffective," FireEye says.

"The malware author calls this technique "Lagos Island method" (allegedly originating from a userland rootkit with this name)."

According to the researchers, FormBook was also seen downloading other malware families such as NanoCore in the last few weeks.

The attackers can even use the data successfully harvested by FormBook for further cybercriminal activities including, identity theft, continued phishing operations, bank fraud and extortion.

FormBook is neither sophisticated, nor difficult-to-detect malware, so the best way to protect yourself from this malware is to keep good antivirus software on your systems, and always keep it up-to-date.

It's 2017, and opening a simple MS Word file could compromise your system.

Security researchers are warning of a new in-the-wild attack that silently installs malware on fully-patched computers by exploiting a serious ‚Äî and yet unpatched ‚Äî zero-day vulnerability in all current versions of Microsoft Office.

The Microsoft Office zero-day attack, uncovered by researchers from security firms McAfee and<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye,</span> starts simply with an email that attaches a malicious Word file containing a booby-trapped OLE2link object.

When opened, the exploit code gets executed and makes a connection to a remote server controlled by the attacker, from where it downloads a malicious HTML application file (HTA) that's disguised as a document created in Microsoft's RTF (Rich Text Format).

The HTA file then gets executed automatically with attackers gaining full code execution on the victim‚Äôs machine, downloading additional payloads from "different well-known malware families" to take over the victim's PC, and closing the weaponized Word file.


Zero-Day Attack Works on All Windows OS ‚Äî Even Windows 10

According to researchers, this zero-day attack is severe as it gives the attackers the power to bypass most exploit mitigations developed by Microsoft, and unlike past Word exploits seen in the wild, it does not require victims to enable Macros.

Due to these capabilities, this newly discovered attack works on all Windows operating systems even against Windows 10, which is believed to be Microsoft's most secure operating system to date.

Besides this, the exploit displays a decoy Word document for the victims to see before terminating in order to hide any sign of the attack.

"The successful exploit closes the bait Word document and pops up a fake one to show the victim," McAfee researchers wrote in a blog post published Friday. "In the background, the malware has already been stealthily installed on the victim's system."

"The root cause of the zero-day vulnerability is related to the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), an important feature of Office."
Microsoft is aware of the zero-day flaw as the researchers say they responsibly disclosed the issue to the company after detecting active attacks leveraging this unpatched flaw back in January this year.

FireEye disclosed the details of the vulnerability a day after McAfee went public with the flaw.

The next scheduled Microsoft's release of security updates is this Tuesday, so it's highly unlikely the company will be able to deliver a patch before that day.


How to Protect Yourself against this Attack?

Since the attack works on fully patched systems, users are highly advised to follow the below recommendations to mitigate such attacks:


Do not open or download any suspicious Word files that arrive in an e-mail, even if you know the sender until Microsoft releases a patch.
Since the attack does not work when a malicious document is viewed in Office Protected View feature, users are advised to enable this feature to view any Office documents.
Always keep your system and antivirus up-to-date.
Regularly backup your files in an external hard-drive.
Disabling Macros does not offer any protection, but yet users are advised to do so in an attempt to protect themselves against other attacks.
Always beware of phishing emails, spams, and clicking the malicious attachment.

Recently we reported about a critical code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Word that was being exploited in the wild by cyber criminal groups to distribute malware like Dridex banking trojans and Latentbot.

Now, it turns out that the same previously undisclosed vulnerability in Word (CVE-2017-0199) was also actively being exploited by the government-sponsored hackers to spy on Russian targets since at least this January.

The news comes after security firm<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye,</span> that independently discovered this flaw last month, published a blog post, revealing that FinSpy spyware was installed as early as January using the same vulnerability in Word that was patched on Tuesday by Microsoft.

For those unaware, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) is a code execution flaw in Word that could allow an attacker to take over a fully patched and up to date computer when the victim opens a Word document containing a booby-trapped OLE2link object,¬†which downloads a malicious HTML app from a server, disguised as a document created in Microsoft's RTF (Rich Text Format).

FinSpy or FinFisher is associated with the controversial UK-based firm Gamma Group, which sells so-called "lawful intercept" spyware to governments around the world.

"Though only one Finspy user has been observed leveraging this zero-day exploit, the historical scope of Finspy, a capability used by several nation-states, suggests other customers had access to it," FireEye researchers said.¬†


"Additionally, this incident exposes the global nature of cyber threats and the value of worldwide perspective‚Äîa cyber espionage incident targeting Russians can provide an opportunity to learn about and interdict crime against English speakers elsewhere."
Months later in March, the same then-zero-day vulnerability was used to install Latentbot, a bot-like, information-stealing and remote-access malware package used by financially motivated criminals.

Latentbot has several malicious capabilities including credential theft, remote desktop functions, hard drive and data wiping, and the ability to disable antivirus software.

FireEye said criminals used social engineering to trick victims into opening the attachments with generic subject lines like "hire_form.doc", "!!!!URGENT!!!!READ!!!.doc", "PDP.doc", and "document.doc".
However, on Monday, the criminals behind the attack modified their campaign to deliver a different malware package called Terdot, which then installed software that uses the TOR anonymity service to hide the identity of the servers it contacted with.

According to FireEye researchers, the MS Word exploit used to install Finspy on Russian computers by government spies and the one used in March to install Latentbot by criminal hackers was obtained from the same source.

This finding highlights that someone who initially discovered this zero-day vulnerability sold it to many actors, including the commercial companies who deals in buying and selling of zero-day exploits as well as financially motivated online criminals.

Also, just Monday evening, Proofpoint researchers too discovered a massive campaign of spam email targeting millions of users across financial institutions in Australia with the Dridex banking malware, again, by exploiting the same vulnerability in Word.

FireEye researchers are still not sure of the source for the exploit that delivered the Dridex banking trojan, but it is possible that the vulnerability disclosure by McAfee last week provided insight that helped Dridex operators use the flaw, or that someone with access to the Word exploit gave it to them.

Microsoft patched the MS Word vulnerability on Tuesday, which hackers, as well as government spies, had been exploiting it for months. So, users are strongly advised to install updates as soon as possible to protect themselves against the ongoing attacks.

Cyber security is a major challenge in today's world, as cyber attacks have become more automated and difficult to detect, where traditional cyber security practices and systems are no longer sufficient to protect businesses, governments, and other organizations.

In past few years, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning had made a name for itself in the field of cyber security, helping IT and security professionals more efficiently and quickly identify risks and anticipate problems before they occur.

The good news is that if you are a Windows 10 user, Microsoft will now offer you a machine learning based threat intelligence feature via its inbuilt Windows security service, which will improve the security capabilities available on Windows 10 devices.

But, the bad news is that it is not free.

The company is offering this "differentiated intelligence" feature on its newly added service to Windows 10, dubbed Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP), which helps enterprises detect, investigate, and respond to advanced attacks on their networks.

This becomes possible after Microsoft recently signed a deal with<span class="highlight-match"> FireEye </span>that integrates the security vendor's iSIGHT Threat Intelligence into Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection.

As part of the partnership, Microsoft will give FireEye access to all the telemetry data from every device running Windows 10, Australian website ARN reports.

"FireEye has invested in nation-state grade threat intelligence, and we are strategically partnering with industry leaders to operationalize this high-quality intel," Ken Gonzalez, FireEye's Vice President of Corporate Development, said in the official press release.

"By working with Microsoft, we‚Äôre able to offer differentiated threat intelligence within WDATP and together help make organizations more secure."
Update:¬†Microsoft denies the claims, saying that the deal does not include any sharing of¬†Microsoft telemetry with FireEye. Here's the official statement provided by a Microsoft Spokesperson to The Hacker News:

"The nature of the deal between Microsoft and FireEye is to license threat intelligence content from FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence. This additional layer of intelligence includes indicators and reports of past attacks collected and edited by FireEye and enhances detection capabilities of Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP). The deal does not include the sharing of Microsoft telemetry."
It's no secret that Windows 10 collects all sorts of usage information on users and sends them back to Microsoft, which then uses this telemetry data to help identify security issues, fix problems and improve the quality of its operating system.

This telemetry data includes information on the device running Windows 10, a list of installed apps, crash dumps, and other statistics from devices powered by its latest operating system.

However, this Microsoft's data mining capability also raised some privacy concerns among Windows users.

This newly-signed deal with FireEye is the first time that Microsoft has publicly agreed to share telemetry data of Windows 10 users with a third-party, which is definitely worrying for many users.

At this moment, the official press release says nothing about Microsoft providing FireEye with access to data collected from Windows 10 users.

Microsoft has yet to comment on this matter.

So far, nobody had an idea that who was behind WannaCry ransomware attacks?

But now there is a clue that lies in the code.

Neel Mehta, a security researcher at Google, found evidence that suggests the WannaCry ransomware, that infected 300,000 machines in 150 countries over the weekend, is linked to a state-sponsored hacking group in North Korea, known for cyber attacks against South Korean organizations.


What's Happening? What is WannaCry?
This is the fifth day since the WannaCry ransomware attack surfaced, that leverages a critical Windows SMB exploit and still infecting machines across the world using newly released variants that don't have any "kill switch" ability.

In case, if you have landed on WannaCry story for the first time, and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, you are advised to also read this simple, summarized, but detailed explanation:

WannaCry: What Has Happened So Far & How to protect your PCs


WannaCry: First Nation-State Powered Ransomware?


Neel discovered that the code found in the WannaCry malware‚Äîone that first surfaced in February‚Äîwas identical to the code used in an early 2015 version of Cantopee, a malicious backdoor developed by Lazarus Group, believed to be a state-sponsored hacking group linked to the North Korean government.

Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab, Intezer,<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec,</span> and Comae Technologies immediately followed the tip from Neel and confirmed a strong link between WannaCry and other malware families, including Lazarus, Joanap, and Brambul, which suggests WannaCry was written or modified by the same author.


Operating since at least 2011, Lazarus Group of hackers believed to be responsible for the 2013 DarkSeoul operation, the devastating 2014 Sony Pictures Hack, and the 2016 Bangladesh $81 Million bank heist.

However, this finding is not yet sufficient to link the Lazarus Group to WannaCry, because it is possible that WannaCry authors may have purposely copied code from Lazarus' backdoor program in an attempt to mislead researchers and law enforcement as they investigate.

"We believe that there are sufficient connections to warrant further investigation. We will continue to share further details of our research as it unfolds," says Symantec, the security firm which has tracked the Lazarus over recent years.

Agreeing to the same, Matt Suiche from Comaeio said:


"The attribution to Lazarus Group would make sense regarding their narrative which in the past was dominated by infiltrating financial institutions in the goal of stealing money. If validated, this means the latest iteration of WannaCry would, in fact, be the first nation state powered ransomware."


Is the WannaCry Attack Over? *NO*

Absolutely Not; this is just the beginning.

Security researchers have discovered some new variants of this ransomware, which could not be stopped by the kill switch, so you are advised to make sure you have applied the patch for SMB vulnerability and disabled SMBv1 protocol to keep your Windows computers safe from WannaCry and other similar attacks.

The WannaCry attackers demand ransom fees between $300 to $600 to free the hijacked data. The three bitcoin wallets tied to #WannaCry ransomware have received 225 payments totaling 35.98003282 BTC (approx. $60,000) from ransomware victims.

A security researcher has disclosed critical issues in the processes and third-party API used by<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec </span>certificate resellers to deliver and manage Symantec SSL certificates.

The flaw, discovered by Chris Byrne, an information security consultant and instructor for Cloud Harmonics, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve other persons' SSL certificates, including public and private keys, as well as to reissue or revoke those certificates.

Even without revoking and reissuing a certificate, attackers can conduct "man-in-the-middle" attack over the secure connections using stolen SSL certs, tricking users into believing they are on a legitimate site when in fact their SSL traffic is being secretly tampered with and intercepted.

"All you had to do was click a link sent in [an] email, and you could retrieve a cert, revoke a cert, and re-issue a cert," Byrne wrote in a Facebook post published over the weekend.


Symantec knew of API Flaws Since 2015

Byrne said he first discovered the issues surrounding Symantec certificates in 2015 and agreed to "limited non-disclosure," as Symantec said the company would take nearly two years to fix the problems.

"Symantec committed to finding and replacing all of the certificates which MAY have been impacted, and then replace them... that they would do so within six months for every cert they could identify, and within two years for every cert period," Byrne said.
The researcher did not disclose any details to the public until last week when Google disclosed its plan to gradually distrust Symantec-issued certificates inside Google Chrome after discovering several issues with the company and four of its third-party cert resellers.

"Given Google's experience and actions here, it appears that Symantec did not fix these issues as they committed to," Byrne said.

However, Byrne was not able to verify that the vulnerability he found were exactly the same issue Google engineers disclosed last week.

According to Byrne, the certificate request and delivery API Symantec provides to its third-party resellers accept URI-based UIDs "without proper authentication, or in some cases, any authentication at all."

Since the API server didn't authenticate users prior to accessing certificate information, any potential tech-savvy customer could have easily intercepted an email containing the API-generated link or took their own UID and modified one of its parameters.

This would have, eventually, allowed the malicious attacker to access information on other Symantec customers, identifying high-value targets, and perform automated attacks.


Gaining Full Control Over Another User's SSL Certificates

Using the same API vulnerabilities, the attacker could have even gained full control over another customer's certificates, which includes obtaining public and private keys, revoking certs, or reissuing certs with new passphrases.

Currently, neither the researcher nor the company has discovered any evidence to prove such a scenario, but the possibility alone was enough for Byrne when considering disclosure.

"It would then be trivial to compromise DNS for a particular organization or person they wanted to attack. At that point, they could pretend to be that person's bank, their credit card company, their employer, anyone," Byrne added.¬†

"Perhaps the worst compromise would be to spoof a patch and update server, for an entire company. Then every single machine at that company could be compromised simultaneously."
According to the researcher, Symantec has since fixed some of the issues, but not all.¬†We have reached out to Symantec, and will update the story as soon as we hear back from the company.

Symantec has not yet responded to the Byrne's disclosure, though the company has recently published two blog posts accusing Google of "exaggerated and misleading" claims the search engine made last month regarding its CAs.


UPDATE: Symantec‚Äôs Response
Symantec has responded to this API flaws and provided the following statement to The Hacker News:

"We have looked into Chris Byrne‚Äôs research claim and could not recreate the problem. We would welcome the proof of concept from the original research in 2015 as well as the most recent research. In addition, we are unaware of any real-world scenario of harm or evidence of the problem. However, we can confirm that no private keys were accessed, as that is not technically feasible."

"We welcome any feedback that helps improve security for the community. Anyone who would like to share further details about real-world scenarios or proof of concept should contact us here."

It‚Äôs been almost four weeks since the outcry of WannaCry ransomware, but the hackers behind the self-spread ransomware threat have not been identified yet.

However, two weeks ago researchers at Google, Kaspersky Lab, Intezer and<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec </span>linked WannaCry to ‚ÄòLazarus Group,‚Äô a state-sponsored hacking group believed to work for the North Korean government.

Now, new research from dark web intelligence firm Flashpoint indicates the perpetrators may be Chinese, based on its own linguistic analysis.

Flashpoint researchers Jon Condra and John Costello analyzed each of WannaCry's localized ransom notes, which is available in 28 languages, for content, accuracy, and style, and discovered that all the notes, except English and Chinese versions (Simplified and Traditional), had been translated via Google Translate.

According to the research, Chinese and English versions of the ransomware notes were most likely written by a human.

On further analysis, researchers discovered that the English ransom note contains a "glaring" grammatical error, which suggests the ransomware author may be a non-native English speaker.


‚ÄúThough the English note appears to be written by someone with a strong command of English, a glaring grammatical error in the note suggest the speaker is non-native or perhaps poorly educated.‚Äù

And since Google Translate does not work good at translating Chinese to English and English to Chinese, and often produces inaccurate results, the English version could be written for translating the ransom note into other languages.



‚ÄúComparisons between the Google translated versions of the English ransomware note to the corresponding WannaCry ransom note yielded nearly identical results, producing a 96% or above match.‚Äù

According to the Flashpoint report, the Chinese ransom notes contain "substantial content not present in any other version of the note," and they are longer than and formatted differently from the English one.

The Chinese ransom notes also use proper grammar, punctuation, syntax, and character choice ‚Äì indicating that the ransomware writer is fluent in the Chinese language.


"A typo in the note, bang zu (Âπ´ÁµÑ) instead of bang zhu (Âπ´Âä©), which means ‚Äòhelp,' strongly indicates the note was written using a Chinese-language input system rather than being translated from a different version," the researchers explain.


"The text uses certain terms that further narrow down a geographic location. One term, libai ( Á¶ÆÊãú ) for ‚Äòweek,‚Äô is more common in southern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore...The other ‚ÄúÊùÄÊØíËΩØ‰ª∂‚Äù for ‚Äúanti-virus‚Äù is more common in the Chinese mainland."

All these clues made Flashpoint researchers into believing with high confidence that the unknown author or authors of WannaCry ransomware are fluent Chinese speaker and that the Chinese are the source of the English version of the ransom note.

However, Flashpoint researchers say it's hard to speculate the nationality of the WannaCry hackers as they may be affiliated to any Asian (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Singapore).

WannaCry epidemic hit more than 300,000 PCs in more than 150 countries within just 72 hours, using self-spreading capabilities to infect vulnerable Windows PCs, particularly those using older versions of the operating system.

While most of the affected organisations have now returned to normal, law enforcement agencies across the world are on the hunt.

	      Google Chrome to Distrust Symantec SSLs for Mis-issuing 30,000 EV Certificates [1.01 Points on average]

Google announced its plans to punish<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec </span>by gradually distrusting its SSL certificates after the company was caught improperly issuing 30,000 Extended Validation (EV) certificates over the past few years.

The Extended Validation (EV) status of all certificates issued by Symantec-owned certificate authorities will no longer be recognized by the Chrome browser for at least a year until Symantec fixes its certificate issuance processes so that it can be trusted again.

Extended validation certificates are supposed to provide the highest level of trust and authentication, where before issuing a certificate, Certificate Authority must verify the requesting entity's legal existence and identity.

The move came into effect immediately after Ryan Sleevi, a software engineer on the Google Chrome team, made this announcement on Thursday in an online forum.

"This is also coupled with a series of failures following the previous set of misissued certificates from Symantec, causing us to no longer have confidence in the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec over the past several years," says Sleevi.

One of the important parts of the SSL ecosystem is Trust, but if CAs will not properly verifying the legal existence and identity before issuing EV certificates for domains, the credibility of those certificates would be compromised.

Google Chrome Team started its investigation on January 19 and found that the certificate issuance policies and practices of Symantec from past several years are dishonest that could threaten the integrity of the TLS system used to authenticate and secure data and connections over the Internet.

Under this move, the Google Chrome team has proposed following steps as punishment:

1. EV certificates issued by Symantec till today will be downgraded to less-secure domain-validated certs, which means Chrome browser will immediately stop displaying the name of the validated domain name holder in the address bar for a period of at least a year.

2. To limit the risk of any further misissuance, all newly-issued certificates must have validity periods of no greater than nine months (effective from Chrome 61 release) to be trusted in Google Chrome.

3. Google proposes an incremental distrust, by gradually reducing the "maximum age" of Symantec certificates over the course of several Chrome releases, requiring them to be reissued and revalidated.

Chrome 59 (Dev, Beta, Stable): 33 months validity (1023 days)
Chrome 60 (Dev, Beta, Stable): 27 months validity (837 days)
Chrome 61 (Dev, Beta, Stable): 21 months validity (651 days)
Chrome 62 (Dev, Beta, Stable): 15 months validity (465 days)
Chrome 63 (Dev, Beta): 9 months validity (279 days)
Chrome 63 (Stable): 15 months validity (465 days)
Chrome 64 (Dev, Beta, Stable): 9 months validity (279 days)
This means, starting with Chrome 64, which is expected to come out in early 2018, the Chrome browser will only trust Symantec certificates issued for nine months (279 days) or less.

Google believes this move will ensure that web developers are aware of the risk of future distrust of Symantec-issued certs, should additional misissuance events occur, while also giving them "the flexibility to continue using such certificates should it be necessary."


Symantec Response ‚Äì Google's Claims Are "Exaggerated and Misleading"

Symantec has responded¬†and stated that the claim of mis-issuing 30,000 SSL certificates made by Google are "Exaggerated and Misleading".

"We strongly object to the action Google has taken to target Symantec SSL/TLS certificates in the Chrome browser. This action was unexpected, and we believe the blog post was irresponsible."

"While all major CAs have experienced SSL/TLS certificate mis-issuance events, Google has singled out the Symantec Certificate Authority in its proposal even though the mis-issuance event identified in Google‚Äôs blog post involved several CAs."

If you have downloaded or updated CCleaner application on your computer between August 15 and September 12 of this year from its official website, then pay attention‚Äîyour computer has been compromised.

CCleaner is a popular application with over 2 billion downloads, created by Piriform and recently acquired by Avast, that allows users to clean up their system to optimize and enhance performance.

Security researchers from Cisco Talos discovered that the download servers used by Avast to let users download the application were compromised by some unknown hackers, who replaced the original version of the software with the malicious one and distributed it to millions of users for around a month.

This incident is yet another example of supply chain attack. Earlier this year, update servers of a Ukrainian company called MeDoc were also compromised in the same way to distribute the Petya ransomware, which wreaked havoc worldwide.

Avast and Piriform have both confirmed that the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware.

Detected on 13 September, the malicious version of CCleaner contains a multi-stage malware payload that steals data from infected computers and sends it to attacker's remote command-and-control servers.


Moreover, the unknown hackers signed the malicious installation executable (v5.33) using a valid digital signature issued to Piriform by<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec </span>and used Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), so that if attackers' server went down, the DGA could generate new domains to receive and send stolen information.

"All of the collected information was encrypted and encoded by base64 with a custom alphabet," says Paul Yung, V.P. of Products at Piriform. "The encoded information was subsequently submitted to an external IP address 216.126.x.x (this address was hardcoded in the payload, and we have intentionally masked its last two octets here) via a HTTPS POST request."

The malicious software was programmed to collect a large number of user data, including:


Computer name
List of installed software, including Windows updates
List of all running processes
IP and MAC addresses
Additional information like whether the process is running with admin privileges and whether it is a 64-bit system.



How to Remove Malware From Your PC

According to the Talos researchers, around 5 million people download CCleaner (or Crap Cleaner) each week, which indicates that more than 20 Million people could have been infected with the malicious version the app.


"The impact of this attack could be severe given the extremely high number of systems possibly affected. CCleaner claims to have over 2 billion downloads worldwide as of November 2016 and is reportedly adding new users at a rate of 5 million a week," Talos said.
However, Piriform estimated that up to 3 percent of its users (up to 2.27 million people) were affected by the malicious installation.

Affected users are strongly recommended to update their CCleaner software to version 5.34 or higher, in order to protect their computers from being compromised. The latest version is available for download here.

"Ransomware" threat is on the rise, and cyber criminals are making millions of dollars by victimizing as many people as they can‚Äîwith WannaCry, NotPetya and LeakerLocker being the ransomware threats that made headlines recently.

What's BAD? Hacker even started selling ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) kits in an attempt to spread this creepy threat more easily, so that even a non-tech user can create their own ransomware and distribute the threat to a wider audience.

The WORSE‚ÄîYou could see a massive increase in the number of ransomware campaigns during the next several months‚Äîthanks to new Android apps available for anyone to download that let them quickly and easily create Android ransomware with their own devices.

Security researchers at Antivirus firm<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec </span>have spotted some Android apps available on hacking forums and through advertisements on a social networking messaging service popular in China, which let any wannabe hacker download and use Trojan Development Kits (TDKs).


How to Create Your Own Android Ransomware

With an easy-to-use interface, these apps are no different from any other Android app apart from the fact that it allows users to create their custom mobile malware with little to no programming knowledge.

To create customized ransomware, users can download one such app (for an obvious reason we are not sharing the links), install and open it, where it offers to choose from the following options, which are displayed on the app's on-screen form:

The message that is to be shown on the locked screen of the infected device


The key to be used to unlock that infected device
The icon to be used by their malware
Custom mathematical operations to randomize the code
Type of animation to be displayed on the infected device


Once all of the information has been filled in, users just require hitting the "Create" button.

If the user hasn't before, the app will prompt him/her to subscribe to the service before proceeding. The app allows the user to start an online chat with its developer where he/she can arrange a one-time payment.

After the payment has been made, the "malware is created and stored in the external storage in ready-to-ship condition," and then the user can continue with the process, making as many as victims as the user can.

"Anyone unlucky enough to be tricked into installing the malware will end up with a locked device held to ransom," Symantec researchers say.¬†

"The malware created using this automation process follows the typical Lockdroid behavior of locking the device‚Äôs screen with a SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW and displaying a text field for the victim to enter the unlock code."
The Lockdroid ransomware has the ability to lock the infected device, change the device PIN, and delete all of its user data through a factory reset, and even prevent the user from uninstalling the malware.

Such apps allow anyone interested in hacking and criminal activities to develop a ready-to-use piece of ransomware malware just by using their smartphones without any need to write a single line of code.

"However, these apps are not just useful for aspiring and inexperienced cyber criminals as even hardened malware authors could find these easy-to-use kits an efficient alternative to putting the work in themselves," the researchers say.
So, get ready to expect an increase in mobile ransomware variants in coming months.


How to Protect Your Android Devices from Ransomware Attacks

In order to protect against such threats on mobile devices, you are recommended to:


Always keep regular backups of your important data.
Make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your machine.
Avoid downloading apps from unknown sites and third-party app stores.
Always pay close attention to the permissions requested by an app, even if it is downloaded from an official app store.
Do not open any email attachments from unknown sources.
Finally, browse the Internet safely.

Watch out, readers! It is ransomware, another WannaCry, another wide-spread attack.

The WannaCry ransomware is not dead yet and another large scale ransomware attack is making chaos worldwide, shutting down computers at corporates, power supplies, and banks across Russia, Ukraine, Spain, France, UK, India, and Europe and demanding $300 in bitcoins.

According to multiple sources, a new variant of Petya ransomware, also known as Petwrap, is spreading rapidly with the help of same Windows SMBv1 vulnerability that the WannaCry ransomware abused to infect 300,000 systems and servers worldwide in just 72 hours last month.

Apart from this, many victims have also informed that Petya ransomware has also infected their patch systems.


"Petya uses the NSA Eternalblue exploit but also spreads in internal networks with WMIC and PSEXEC. That's why patched systems can get hit." Mikko Hypponen¬†confirms, Chief Research Officer at F-Secure.

Petya is a nasty piece of ransomware and works very differently from any other ransomware malware. Unlike other traditional ransomware, Petya does not encrypt files on a targeted system one by one.

Instead, Petya reboots victims computers and encrypts the hard drive's master file table (MFT) and renders the master boot record (MBR) inoperable, restricting access to the full system by seizing information about file names, sizes, and location on the physical disk.

Petya ransomware replaces the computer's MBR with its own malicious code that displays the ransom note and leaves computers unable to boot.


Don't Pay Ransom, You Wouldn‚Äôt Get Your Files Back¬†
Infected users are advised not to pay the ransom because hackers behind Petya ransomware can‚Äôt get your emails anymore.

Posteo, the German email provider, has suspended the email address i.e. wowsmith123456@posteo.net, which was behind used by the criminals to communicate with victims after getting the ransom to send the decryption keys.

At the time of writing, 23 victims have¬†paid¬†in Bitcoin to '1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX' address¬†for decrypting their files infected by Petya, which total roughly $6775.

Petya! Petya! Another Worldwide Ransomware Attack



Screenshots of the latest Petya infection, shared on Twitter, shows that the ransomware displays a text, demanding $300 worth of Bitcoins. Here's what the text read:

"If you see this text, then your files are no longer accessible, because they are encrypted. Perhaps you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don't waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service."
According to a recent VirusTotal scan, currently, only 16 out of 61 anti-virus services are successfully detecting the Petya ransomware malware.


Petya Ransomware Hits Banks, Telecom, Businesses & Power Companies


Supermarket in Kharkiv, East Ukraine

Petya ransomware has already infected ‚Äî¬†Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft, Ukrainian state electricity suppliers, "Kyivenergo" and "Ukrenergo," in past few hours.

"We were attacked. Two hours ago, we had to turn off all our computers. We are waiting for permission from Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) to switch them back on," Kyivenergo's press service said.
There are reports from several banks, including National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and Oschadbank, as well as other companies confirming they have been hit by the Petya ransomware attacks.

Maersk, an international logistics company, has also confirmed on Twitter that the latest Petya ransomware attacks have shut down its IT systems at multiple locations and business units.

"We can confirm that Maersk IT systems are down across multiple sites and business units. We are currently asserting the situation. The safety of our employees, our operations and customers' business is our top priority. We will update when we have more information," the company said.
The ransomware also impacts multiple workstations at Ukrainian branch's mining company Evraz.

The most severe damages reported by Ukrainian businesses also include¬†compromised systems at Ukraine's local metro and Kiev's Boryspil Airport.

Three Ukrainian telecommunication operators, Kyivstar, LifeCell, Ukrtelecom, are also affected in the latest Petya attack.


How Petya Ransomware Spreading So Fast?
<span class="highlight-match">
Symantec,</span> the cyber security company, has also confirmed that Petya ransomware is exploiting SMBv1 EternalBlue exploit,¬†just like¬†WannaCry, and taking advantage of unpatched Windows machines.

"Petya ransomware successful in spreading because it combines both a client-side attack (CVE-2017-0199) and a network based threat (MS17-010),"¬†security¬†researcher using Twitter handle ‚ÄèHackerFantastic¬†tweeted.

EternalBlue is a Windows SMB exploit leaked by the infamous hacking group Shadow Brokers in its April data dump, who claimed to have stolen it from the US intelligence agency NSA, along with other Windows exploits.

Microsoft has since patched the vulnerability for all versions of Windows operating systems, but many users remain vulnerable, and a string of malware variants are exploiting the flaw to deliver ransomware and mine cryptocurrency.

Just three days ago, we reported about the latest WannaCry attack that hit Honda Motor Company and around 55 speed¬†and traffic light cameras in Japan and Australia, respectively.

Well, it is quite surprising that even after knowing about the WannaCry issue for quite a decent amount of time, big corporates and companies have not yet implemented proper security measures to defend against such threat.


How to Protect Yourself from Ransomware Attacks


What to do immediately? Go and apply those¬†goddamn patches¬†against EternalBlue (MS17-010) and disable the unsecured, 30-year-old¬†SMBv1 file-sharing protocol¬†on your Windows systems and¬†servers.

Since¬†Petya Ransomware is also taking advantage of WMIC and PSEXEC tools to infect fully-patched Windows computers, you are also advised to disable WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line).


Prevent Infection & Petya Kill-Switch
Researcher¬†finds¬†Petya ransomware encrypt systems after rebooting the computer. So if your system is infected with Petya ransomware and it tries to restart, just do not power it back on.

"If machine reboots and you see this message, power off immediately! This is the encryption process. If you do not power on, files are fine." ‚ÄèHackerFantastic¬†tweeted. "Use a LiveCD or external machine to recover files"
PT Security, a UK-based cyber security company and¬†Amit Serper¬†from Cybereason, have discovered a Kill-Switch for Petya ransomware. According to a tweet, company has advised users to create a file i.e. "C:\Windows\perfc" to prevent ransomware infection.

To safeguard against any ransomware infection, you should always be suspicious of unwanted files and documents sent over an email and should never click on links inside them unless verifying the source.

To always have a tight grip on your valuable data, keep a good back-up routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that isn't always connected to your PC.

Moreover, make sure that you run a good and effective anti-virus security suite on your system, and keep it up-to-date. Most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

Security researchers have confirmed that the alleged CIA hacking tools recently exposed by WikiLeaks have been used against at least 40 governments and private organizations across 16 countries.

Since March, as part of its "Vault 7" series, Wikileaks has published over 8,761 documents and other confidential information that the whistleblower group claims came from the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

Now, researchers at cybersecurity company<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec </span>reportedly managed to link those CIA hacking tools to numerous real cyber attacks in recent years that have been carried out against the government and private sectors across the world.

Those 40 cyber attacks were conducted by Longhorn ‚Äî a North American hacking group that has been active since at least 2011 and has used backdoor trojans and zero-day attacks to target government, financial, energy, telecommunications, education, aerospace, and natural resources sectors.

Although the group's targets were all in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa, researchers said the group once infected a computer in the United States, but an uninstaller was launched within an hour, which indicates the "victim was infected unintentionally."

What's interesting is that Symantec linked some of CIA hacking tools and malware variants disclosed by Wikileaks in the Vault 7 files to Longhorn cyber espionage operations.


Fluxwire (Created by CIA) ‚âÖ Corentry (Created by Longhorn)

Fluxwire, a cyber espionage malware allegedly created by the CIA and mentioned in the Vault 7 documents, contains a changelog of dates for when new features were added, which according to Symantec, closely resemble with the development cycle of "Corentry," a malware created by Longhorn hacking group.

"Early versions of Corentry seen by Symantec contained a reference to the file path for the Fluxwire program database (PDB) file," Symantec explains. "The Vault 7 document lists removal of the full path for the PDB as one of the changes implemented in Version 3.5.0."

"Up until 2014, versions of Corentry were compiled using GCC [GNU Compiler Collection]. According to the Vault 7 document, Fluxwire switched to an MSVC compiler for version 3.3.0 on February 25, 2015. This was reflected in samples of Corentry, where a version compiled on February 25, 2015, had used MSVC as a compiler."


Similar Malware Modules

Another Vault 7 document details 'Fire and Forget' specification of the payload and a malware module loader called Archangel, which Symantec claims, match almost perfectly with a Longhorn backdoor called Plexor.

"The specification of the payload and the interface used to load it was closely matched in another Longhorn tool called Backdoor.Plexor," says Symantec.


Use of Similar Cryptographic Protocol Practices

Another leaked CIA document outlined cryptographic protocols that should be used within malware tools, such as using AES encryption with a 32-bit key, inner cryptography within SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, and key exchanges once per connection.

One leaked CIA document also recommends using of in-memory string de-obfuscation and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for communicating with the command and control (C&C) servers.

According to Symantec, these cryptographic protocol and communication practices were also used by Longhorn group in all of its hacking tools.


More About LongHorn Hacking Group

Longhorn has been described as a well-resourced hacking group that works on a standard Monday to Friday working week ‚Äî likely a behavior of a state-sponsored group ‚Äî and operates in an American time zone.

Longhorn's advanced malware tools are specially designed for cyber espionage with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The group uses extremely stealthy capabilities in its malware to avoid detection.

Symantec analysis of the group's activities also shows that Longhorn is from an English speaking North American country with code words used by it referring, the band The Police with code words REDLIGHT and ROXANNE, and colloquial terms like "scoobysnack."

Overall, the functionality described in the CIA documents and its links to the group activities leave "little doubt that Longhorn's activities and the Vault 7 documents are the work of the same group."

The notorious hacking group that has been in operation since at least 2011 has re-emerged and is still interested in targeting the United States and European companies in the energy sector.

Yes, I am talking about the 'Dragonfly,' a well-resourced, Eastern European hacking group responsible for sophisticated cyber-espionage campaigns against the critical infrastructure of energy companies in different countries in past years.

In 2014, we reported about the Dragonfly groups ability to mount sabotage operations against their targets‚Äîmainly petroleum pipeline operators, electricity generation firms and other Industrial Control Systems (ICS) equipment providers for the energy sector.

Researchers from cyber security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec </span>who discovered the previous campaign is now warning of a new campaign, which they dubbed Dragonfly 2.0, saying "the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so" and has already gained unprecedented access to operational systems of Western energy firms.

Here are the major highlights of the group activities outlined in the new report from Symantec:


The hacking group has been active since late 2015 and reportedly using same tactics and tools that were used in earlier campaigns.
The major objective of the Dragonfly 2.0 group is to collect intelligence and gain access to the networks of the targeted organization, eventually making the group capable of mounting sabotage operations when required.
Dragonfly 2.0 majorly targeting the critical energy sectors in the U.S., Turkey, and Switzerland.
Like previous Dragonfly campaigns, the hackers are using malicious email (containing very specific content related to the energy sector) attachments, watering hole attacks, and Trojanized software as an initial attack vector to gain access to a victim's network.
The group is using a toolkit called Phishery (available on GitHub) to perform email-based attacks that host template injection attack to steal victim's credentials.
Malware campaign involves multiple remote access Trojans masquerading as Flash updates called, Backdoor.Goodor, Backdoor.Dorshel and Trojan.Karagany.B, allowing attackers to provide remote access to the victim's machine.



However, Symantec researchers did not find any evidence of the Dragonfly 2.0 group using any zero day vulnerabilities. Instead, the hacking group strategically uses publically available administration tools like PowerShell, PsExec, and Bitsadmin, making attribution more difficult.

"The Dragonfly 2.0 campaigns show how the attackers may be entering into a new phase, with recent campaigns potentially providing them with access to operational systems, access that could be used for more disruptive purposes in future," Symantec believes.
Cyber attacks on energy grids are not a new thing. Energy companies in Ukraine targeted by hackers on two different occasions in late 2015 and late 2016, actually caused the power outage across several regions in Ukraine, causing a blackout for tens of thousands of citizens around midnight.

Moreover,¬†Nuclear facilities in the United States, including Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, were targeted by a well-known Russian group back in July this year, but luckily there's no proof if the hackers were able to gain access to the operational systems or not.

The Shadow Brokers who previously stole and leaked a portion of the NSA hacking tools and exploits is back with a Bang!

The hacking group is now selling another package of hacking tools, ‚ÄúEquation Group Windows Warez,‚Äù which includes Windows exploits and antivirus bypass tools, stolen from the NSA-linked hacking unit, The Equation Group.

For those unfamiliar with the topic, The Shadow Brokers is a notorious group of black-hat hackers who, in August 2016, leaked exploits, security vulnerabilities, and "powerful espionage tools" created by The Equation Group.

On Saturday, the Shadow Brokers posted a message on their ZeroNet based website, announcing the sale of the entire "Windows Warez" collection for 750 Bitcoin (around US$678,630).

The data dump contains many windows hacking tools, categorized as following:

Fuzzing tools (used to discover errors and security loopholes)
Exploit Framework
Network Implants
Remote Administration Tools (RAT)
Remote Code Execution Exploits for IIS, RDP, RPC, SMB Protocols (Some Zero-Days)
SMB BackDoor (Implant)

Interestingly, the Remote Administration Tool (RAT) "DanderSpritz" included in the list is the one previously leaked in the NSA's documents revealed by Edward Snowden.

Besides this, malware researcher Jacob Williams analyzed the archive of "screenshots and output of the find command across the dump" provided by the hacker as an evidence of legitimacy and estimated that the tools may also include a Fully Undetectable Malware (FUD) toolkit.


The FUD toolkit might have an ability to "evade/bypass personal security products," such as Avira, Avast, Dr.Web, ESET Antivirus, Comodo, McAfee Antivirus, Microsoft Essential, Panda,<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec,</span> Trend Micro and Kaspersky Antivirus.

The buyers can purchase the entire database of hacking tools that The Equation Group used against various countries to expand its espionage operations.

In August, the Shadow Brokers announced an auction attempting to sell the complete set of tools to the highest bidder, but the group canceled their auction in October due to little or no response on their public sale.

But since this time the group has made Windows hacking tools up for sale, the chances are that hackers and espionage groups would be interested in buying these hacking tools.

As part of its Vault 7 series of leaked documents, whistleblowing website WikiLeaks today released a new cache of 27 documents allegedly belonged to the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

Named Grasshopper, the latest batch reveals a CLI-based framework developed by the CIA to build "customised malware" payloads for breaking into Microsoft's Windows operating systems and bypassing antivirus protection.

All the leaked documents are basically a user manual that the agency flagged as "secret" and that are supposed to be only accessed by the members of the agency, WikiLeaks claims.


Grasshopper: Customized Malware Builder Framework

According to the leaked documents, Grasshopper framework allows the agency members to easily create custom malware, depending upon the technical details, such as what operating system and antivirus the targets are using.

The Grasshopper framework then automatically puts together several components sufficient for attacking the target, and finally, delivers a Windows installer that the agency members can run on a target's computer and install their custom malware payloads.

"A Grasshopper executable contains one or more installers. An installer is a stack of one or more installer components," the documentation reads. "Grasshopper invokes each component of the stack in series to operate on a payload. The ultimate purpose of an installer is to persist a payload."
The whistleblowing website claimed the Grasshopper toolset was allegedly designed to go undetected even from the anti-virus products from the world's leading vendors including Kaspersky Lab,<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec,</span> and Microsoft.


CIA's Grasshopper Uses 'Stolen' Russian Malware

According to WikiLeaks, the CIA created the Grasshopper framework as a modern cyber-espionage solution not only to be as easy to use as possible but also "to maintain persistence over infected Microsoft Windows computers."

"Grasshopper allows tools to be installed using a variety of persistence mechanisms and modified using a variety of extensions (like encryption)," Wikileaks said in the press release.
One of the so-called persistence mechanisms linked to Grasshopper is called Stolen Goods (Version 2), which shows how the CIA adapted known malware developed by cyber criminals across the world and modified it for its own uses.

One such malware is "Carberp," which is a malware rootkit developed by Russian hackers.

"The persistence method and parts of the installer were taken and modified to fit our needs," the leaked document noted. "A vast majority of the original Carberp code that was used has been heavily modified. Very few pieces of the original code exist unmodified."
It is not yet clear how recently the CIA has used the hacking tools mentioned in the documentation, but WikiLeaks says the tools were used between 2012 and 2015.

So far, Wikileaks has revealed the "Year Zero" batch which uncovered CIA hacking exploits for popular hardware and software, the "Dark Matter" batch which focused on exploits and hacking techniques the agency designed to target iPhones and Macs, and the third batch called "Marble."

Marble revealed the source code of a secret anti-forensic framework, basically an obfuscator or a packer used by the CIA to hide the actual source of its malware.

It should be noted that hacking a system for unauthorised access that does not belong to you is an illegal practice, no matter what's the actual intention behind it.

Now I am pointing out this because reportedly someone, who has been labeled as a 'vigilante hacker' by media, is hacking into vulnerable 'Internet of Things' devices in order to supposedly secure them.

This is not the first time when any hacker has shown vigilance, as we have seen lots of previous incidents in which hackers have used malware to compromise thousands of devices, but instead of hacking them, they forced owners to make them secure.

Dubbed Hajime, the latest IoT botnet malware, used by the hacker, has already infected at least 10,000 home routers, Internet-connected cameras, and other smart devices.

But reportedly, it's an attempt to wrestle their control from Mirai and other malicious threats.

Mirai is an IoT botnet that threatened the Internet last year with record-setting distributed denial-of-service attacks against the popular DNS provider Dyn last October. The botnet designed to scan for IoT devices that are still using default passwords.


How the Hajime IoT Botnet Works

Hajime botnet works much like Mirai ‚Äî it spreads via unsecured IoT devices that have open Telnet ports and uses default passwords ‚Äî and also uses the same list of username and password combinations that Mirai botnet is programmed to use, with the addition of two more.

However, what's interesting about Hajime botnet is that, unlike Mirai, it secures the target devices by blocking access to four ports (23, 7547, 5555, and 5358) known to be vectors used to attack many IoT devices, making Mirai or other threats out of their bay.

Unlike Mirai, Hajime uses a decentralized peer-to-peer network (instead of command and control server) to issue commands and updates to infected devices, which makes it more difficult for ISPs and Internet backbone providers to take down the botnet.

Hajime botnet also takes steps to hide its running processes and files on the file system, making the detection of infected systems more difficult.

Besides this, Hajime botnet also lacks DDoS capabilities or any other hacking code except for the propagation code that lets one infected device search for other vulnerable devices and infects them.

One of the most interesting things about Hajime: the botnet displays a cryptographically signed message every 10 minutes or so on terminals. The message reads:


Just a white hat, securing some systems.

Important messages will be signed like this!

Hajime Author.

Contact CLOSED Stay sharp!¬†

There's Nothing to Get Excited¬†

No doubt, there's a temptation to applaud Hajime, but until users don't reboot their hacked devices.

Since Hajime has no persistence mechanism, which gets loaded into the devices' RAM, once the IoT device is rebooted, it goes back to its unsecured state, complete with default passwords and the Telnet port open to the world.

"One day a device may belong to the Mirai botnet, after the next reboot it could belong to Hajime, then the next any of the many other IoT malware/worms that are out there scanning for devices with hard coded passwords. This cycle will continue with each reboot until the device is updated with a newer, more secure firmware," the<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec </span>researchers explained.

There's another problem...

Hacking someone to prevent hacking is not a thing, that‚Äôs why we are also concerned about a related amendment passed by the United States ‚Äî Rule 41 ‚Äî which grants the FBI much greater powers to legally break into computers belonging to any country, take data, and engage in remote surveillance.

So, the most concerning issue of all ‚Äî Is there any guarantee that the author of Hajime will not add attack capabilities to the worm to use the hijacked devices for malicious purposes?

A Chinese certificate authority (CA) appeared to be making a significant security blunder by handing out duplicate SSL certificates for a base domain if someone just has control over its any subdomain. 

The certificate authority, named WoSign, issued a base certificate for the Github domains to an unnamed GitHub user.

But How? First of all, do you know, the traditional Digital Certificate Management System is the weakest link on the Internet today and has already been broken?

Billions of Internet users blindly rely on hundreds of Certificate Authorities (CA) around the globe to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of their personal data.

But, these CAs have powers to issue valid SSL cert for any domain you own, despite the fact you already have one purchased from another CA. 

...and that's the biggest loophole in the CA system.

In the latest case as well, WoSign issued a duplicate SSL certificate for GitHub domains without verifying ownership of the base domain.

The incident was first publicly disclosed by British Mozilla programmer Gervase Markham on Mozilla's security policy mailing list saying the issue occurred over a year ago in July 2015 but went unreported.

"In June 2015, an applicant found a problem with WoSign's free certificate service, which allowed them to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of a subdomain," Markham wrote in the mailing list.
According to Markham, an unnamed security researcher accidentally discovered this security blunder when trying to get a certificate for 'med.ucf.edu' but mistakenly also applied for 'www.ucf.edu' and WoSign approved it, handing over the certificate for the university's primary domain.

For testing purpose, the researcher also used this trick against Github base domains i.e. github.com and github.io, by proving his control over a user-based subdomain.

...And guess what? WoSign handed over the certificate for GitHub main domains, too.

The researcher reported this issue to WoSign by giving only the Github certificate as an example. Thus, the Chinese CA only revoked the GitHub certificate, despite revoking both the certificates.

Why Just One? It is quite possible that the CA company doesn't have any tracking ability to discover and revoke all mistakenly issued base certificates for other domains by self-investigation even after getting informed of the problem.

The researcher recently got in touch with Google and reported that the ucf.edu cert had still not been revoked almost a year later.

How to check whether a rogue cert for your domain has been issued to someone else, probably a malicious attacker?



Solution: Certificate Transparency or CT, a public service that allows individuals and companies to monitor how many digital security certs have secretly been issued for their domains.

Certificate Transparency requires CAs to declare publicly (to Certificate Log) every digital cert they have generated. Even WoSign has participated in CT.

Certificate Log offers you a way to look up all of the digital certificates that have been issued for your domain name.

Although Certificate Transparency doesn't prevent CA from issuing forged certificates, it makes the process of detecting rogue certificates much easier.

Currently, Google,<span class="highlight-match"> Symantec,</span> DigiCert, and a few other CAs are hosting public CT logs. 

You can try Google's Certificate Transparency Lookup Tool or Comodo's Certificate Transparency Search tool to check all certificates present in public Certificate Transparency logs that have been issued for your domain.

If you find a fraud certificate issued for your domain, report respective CA and address it immediately.

Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment as it takes a monstrous amount of computing power, and thus hackers have started using malware that steals computing resources of computers it hijacks to make lots of dollars in digital currency.

Security researchers at security firm<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>have spotted one such malware that infected hundreds of Windows web servers with a malicious cryptocurrency miner and helped cybercriminals made more than $63,000 worth of Monero (XMR) in just three months.

According to a report published by ESET today, cybercriminals only made modifications to legitimate open source Monero mining software and exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft IIS 6.0 to secretly install the miner on unpatched Windows servers.

Although ESET's investigation does not identify the attackers, it reports that the attackers have been infecting unpatched Windows web servers with the cryptocurrency miner since at least May 2017 to mine 'Monero,' a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency.

The vulnerability (CVE-2017-7269) exploited by the attackers was discovered in March 2017 by Zhiniang Peng and Chen Wu and resides in the WebDAV service of Microsoft IIS version 6.0‚Äîthe web server in Windows Server 2003 R2.

Therefore, hackers are only targeting unpatched machines running Windows Server 2003 to make them part of a botnet, which has already helped them made over $63,000 worth of Monero.



Since the vulnerability is on a web server, which is meant to be visible from the internet, it can be accessed and exploited by anyone. You can learn more about the vulnerability here.

The newly discovered malware mines Monero that has a total market valuation of about $1.4 billion, which is far behind Bitcoin in market capitalisation, but cybercriminals‚Äô love for Monero is due to its focus on privacy.

Unlike Bitcoin, Monero offers untraceable transactions and is anonymous cryptocurrency in the world today.

Another reason of hackers favouring Monero is that it uses a proof-of-work algorithm called CryptoNight, which suits computer or server CPUs and GPUs, while Bitcoin mining requires specific mining hardware.

However, this is not the first time when analysts have spotted such malware mining Monero by stealing computing resources of compromised computers.

In mid-May, Proofpoint researcher Kafeine discovered cryptocurrency mining malware, called 'Adylkuzz,' which was using EternalBlue exploit‚Äîcreated by the NSA and dumped last month by the Shadow Brokers in April‚Äîto infect unpatched Windows systems to mine Monero.

A week before that, GuardiCore researchers discovered a new botnet malware, dubbed BondNet, that was also infecting Windows systems, with a combination of techniques, for primarily mining Monero.

"Linux doesn't get viruses" ‚Äî It's a Myth.

A new Trojan has been discovered in the wild that turns Linux-based devices into proxy servers, which attackers use to protect their identity while launching cyber attacks from the hijacked systems.

Dubbed Linux.Proxy.10, the Trojan was first spotted at the end of last year by the researchers from Russian security firm Doctor Web, who later identified thousand of compromised machines by the end of January this year and the campaign is still ongoing and hunting for more Linux machines.

According to researchers, the malware itself doesn't include any exploitation module to hack into Linux machines; instead, the attackers are using other Trojans and techniques to compromise devices at the first place and then create a new backdoor login account using  the username as "mother" and password as "fucker."

Once backdoored and the attacker gets the list of all successfully compromised Linux machines, and then logs into them via SSH protocol and installs the SOCKS5 proxy server using Linux.Proxy.10 malware on it.

This Linux malware is not at all sophisticated since it uses a freeware source code of the Satanic Socks Server to setup a proxy.

According to the security firm, thousands of Linux-based devices have already been infected with this new Trojan.


Besides this, the same server ‚Äî belonging to the cybercriminals who distribute the Linux.Proxy.10 malware ‚Äî not only contained the list of compromised devices but also hosted the control panel of a Spy-Agent computer monitoring software and a Windows malware from a known family of Trojan spyware, called BackDoor.TeamViewer.

This is not the first time when such Linux malware has been discovered. 

Over a year ago,<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>security researchers uncovered a similar malware, dubbed Moose, that also had the capability to turn Linux devices into proxy servers that were then used for launching armies of fake accounts on social media networks, including Instagram, and Twitter.

Linux users and administrators are recommended to tighten SSH security by limiting or disabling remote root access via SSH, and to know if your system has already been compromised, keep a regular watch on newly generated login users.

Security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>have discovered a new malware campaign targeting consulates, ministries and embassies worldwide to spy on governments and diplomats.

Active since 2016, the malware campaign is leveraging a new backdoor, dubbed Gazer, and is believed to be carried out by Turla advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group that's been previously linked to Russian intelligence.

Gazer, written in C++, the backdoor delivers via spear phishing emails and hijacks targeted computers in two steps‚Äîfirst, the malware drops Skipper backdoor, which has previously been linked to Turla and then installs Gazer components.

In previous cyber espionage campaigns, the Turla hacking group used Carbon and Kazuar backdoors as its second-stage malware, which also has many similarities with Gazer, according to research [PDF] published by ESET.

Gazer receives encrypted commands from a remote command-and-control server and evades detection by using compromised, legitimate websites (that mostly use the WordPress CMS) as a proxy.


Instead of using Windows Crypto API, Gazer uses custom 3DES and RSA encryption libraries to encrypt the data before sending it to the C&C server‚Äîa common tactic employed by the Turla APT group.

Gazer uses code-injection technique to take control of a machine and hide itself for a long period of time in an attempt to steal information.

Gazer backdoor also has the ability to forward commands received by one infected endpoint to the other infected machines on the same network.

So far ESET researchers have identified four different variants of the Gazer malware in the wild, primarily spying on Southeast European and former Soviet bloc political targets.

Interestingly, earlier versions of Gazer were signed with a valid certificate issued by Comodo for "Solid Loop Ltd," while the latest version is signed with an SSL certificate issued to "Ultimate Computer Support Ltd."

According to researchers, Gazer has already managed to infect a number of targets worldwide, with the most victims being located in Europe.

Meanwhile, Kaspersky lab has also published almost similar details about Gazer backdoor, but they called it 'Whitebear' APT campaign.

As part of this month's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has released security patches for a total of 55 vulnerabilities across its products, including fixes for four zero-day vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.

Just yesterday, Microsoft released an emergency out-of-band update separately to patch a remote execution bug (CVE-2017-0290) in Microsoft's Antivirus Engine that comes enabled by default on Windows 7, 8.1, RT, 10 and Server 2016 operating systems.

The vulnerability, reported by Google Project Zero researchers, could allow an attacker to take over your Windows PC with just an email, which you haven't even opened yet.

May 2017 Patch Tuesday ‚Äî Out of 55 vulnerabilities, 17 have been rated as critical and affect the company's main operating systems, along with other products like Office, Edge, Internet Explorer, and the malware protection engine used in most of the Microsoft's anti-malware products.

Sysadmins all over the world should prioritize the May's Patch Tuesday as it addresses four critical zero-day vulnerabilities, three of which being actively exploited by cyber-espionage groups in targeted attacks over the past few months.


3 Zero-Days Were Exploited in the Wild by Russian Cyber-Espionage Group

First Zero-Day Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0261) ‚Äî It affects the 32- and 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office 2010, 2013 and 2016, and resides in how Office handles Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) image files, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the system.

This Office vulnerability could be exploited by tricking victims into opening a file containing a malformed graphics image in an email. The attack also exploits a Windows privilege escalation bug (CVE-2017-0001) that the company patched on March 14 to gain full control over the system ‚Äì essentially allowing attackers to install spyware and other malware.

According to the FireEye researchers, the CVE-2017-0261 flaw has been exploited since late March by an unknown group of financially motivated hackers and by a Russian cyber espionage group called Turla, also known as Snake or Uroburos.

Second Zero-Day Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0262) ‚Äî FireEye and<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>researchers believe that the APT28 hacking group, also known as Fancy Bear, or Pawn Storm, was actively using this EPS-related Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability which leads to remote code execution on opening a malformed file.

Third Zero-Day Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0263) ‚Äî The third zero-day bug is an elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability in all supported versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system.

This vulnerability exists in the way Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code in kernel mode and then install malware, view, change, or delete data, and even create new accounts with full user rights.

Researchers believe that the Russian cyber-espionage group was also actively exploiting this flaw (CVE-2017-0263) along with the second zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2017-0262).

Fourth Zero-Day Vulnerability (CVE-2017-0222) ‚Äî Another zero-day vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 10 and 11 and resides in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

Opening a malicious web page can corrupt memory to trigger remote code execution, allowing attackers to take control of an affected system. According to the tech giant, this issue was also exploited in the wild.

Patches for Other Critical Vulnerabilities ‚Äî This month's security updates also fix critical vulnerabilities in both Edge and Internet Explorer (IE) that could lead to remote code execution by tricking victims into visiting malicious websites or viewing specially crafted advertisements inside the browsers.

Besides this, Microsoft also addresses four critical remote code execution bugs (CVE-2017-0272, CVE-2017-0277, CVE-2017-0278, and CVE-2017-0279) in Windows SMB network file-sharing protocol, which affects Windows 7 through 10 and Windows Server 2008 through 2016.

These vulnerabilities put Windows PCs and server installations at risk of hacking if they use SMBv1, though there have been no reports of any of these flaws exploited in the wild.

As usual, Adobe Flash Players patches are also included in the security update to address 7 CVE-listed flaws in the Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Windows users are strongly advised to install the latest updates as soon as possible in order to protect themselves against the active attacks in the wild.

	      KillDisk Ransomware Targets Linux; Demands $250,000 Ransom, But Won't Decrypt Files [1.01 Points on average]

What you'll do if Ransomware infects you? Should you pay or not to recover your files?

Believe me, the FBI advises - Pay off the criminals to get your files back if you don't have a backup.

But paying off a ransom to cyber criminals is definitely not a wise option because there is no guarantee that you'll get the decryption key in return.

In the latest incident, the new variant of KillDisk ransomware has been found encrypting Linux machines, making them unbootable with data permanently lost.

What is KillDisk? KillDisk is a destructive data wiping malware that has previously been used to sabotage companies by randomly deleting files from the computers.

KillDisk is the same component associated with the Black Energy malware that was used to hit several Ukrainian power stations in 2015, cutting power for thousands of people.

But according to<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>security researchers, the nasty KillDisk disk wiper malware is back with new variants that target Windows and Linux desktops and servers, encrypt files and then ask for an unusually large ransom:

Around $218,000 in Bitcoins ‚Äì possibly the world's most expensive ransom attacks.

What's even worst? Linux variant of the KillDisk ransomware does not store the encryption key anywhere on disk or command-and-control server.

So, even after you pay this extremely large ransom, you are not going to get any decryption key for recovery of your important files.

The good news is that ESET researchers have found a weakness in the encryption employed by the Linux variant which makes recovery of encrypted files possible, though difficult. But the same flaw doesn't exist in the Windows variant of the KillDisk ransomware.


KillDisk Deletes your¬†Files Even After Paying¬†$218,000

According to researchers, the files of victims targeted with the Linux variant of the malware are encrypted using "Triple-DES applied to 4096-byte file blocks," and each file on the computer is encrypted by a different set of 64-bit encryption keys.

The malware then displays the ransom note in an unusual manner: within the GRUB bootloader, which means the KillDisk Linux ransomware overwrites the bootloader entries to show ransom text that asks victims to pay 222 Bitcoin.

But paying off the criminals ransom will not bring your files back, as the Linux variant does not store decryption keys anywhere.

"KillDisk serves as another example of why paying ransom should not be considered an option. When dealing with criminals, there's no guarantee of getting your data back ‚Äì in this case, the criminals clearly never intended to deliver on their promises," says Robert Lipovsk√Ω, ESET Senior Researcher.

Prevention is the Best Practice
So, the only safe way of dealing with ransomware is prevention. As I previously recommended, the best defense against Ransomware is to create awareness within the organizations, as well as maintaining back-ups that are rotated regularly.

Most viruses are introduced by opening infected attachments or clicking on links to malware usually in spam emails. So, DO NOT CLICK on links provided in emails and attachments from unknown sources.

Moreover, ensure that your systems are running the latest version of Antivirus software with up to date malware definitions.

Ukrainian National Police has released a video showing officers raiding company of M.E.Doc accounting software makers, whose systems have been linked to outbreak of Petya (NotPetya) ransomware that recently infected computers of several major companies worldwide.

On 4th July, masked police officers from Ukrainian anti-cybercrime unit ‚Äî carrying shotguns and assault rifles ‚Äî raided the software development firm ‚ÄúIntellect Service,‚Äù in the capital city Kyiv and seized their servers, which were reportedly compromised by hackers to spread (ExPetr, PetrWrap, Petya, NotPetya) ransomware.

Researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>security firm have found a very stealthy malicious code in the M.E.Doc software update which was injected by an unknown hacker or group of hackers in mid-April by exploiting a vulnerability.

The malicious software upgrade, designed to install a backdoor and give unauthorized remote access to attackers, was then delivered as an update to nearly 1 million computers belonging to its client companies.


Researchers explain that the backdoor installed in endpoint computers was designed to allow hackers to execute various commands remotely and further install other malicious programs, eventually used to conduct WannaCry like global ransomware attack.

The software company previously denied its servers had been compromised, but several researchers and even Microsoft blamed the company for being "patient zero" for the NotPetya attack.

Ukrainian authority has also said that the company could face charges.

Moreover, the Petya investigation took interesting twist last week when researchers found that NotPetya is not a ransomware; instead, it‚Äôs a destructive piece of ‚Äúwiper‚Äù malware designed to destroy all records from the targeted systems, making organizations to shut down their operations.



Ukrainian authority has recommended M.E.Doc customers to stop using its accounting software until further notice. So, you are supposed to turn off your computers if it has the M.E.Doc software installed on and change your passwords.

Ukraine believes Russia is behind the NotPetya cyber attack that shut down the nation's critical operations, including the airport, local metro, hospitals, and government, but authorities are still investigating the case.


NotPetya Hacker Demands 100 Bitcoins for the Decryption Key


It was also reported today that the hackers connected to the NotPetya ransomware moved $10,000 worth of Bitcoins from the online wallet they were using to receive payments from victims to a different wallet.

After that someone claimed to be connected to NotPetya Posted an announcement on DeepPaste and Pastebin, asking for 100 Bitcoins (roughly $256,000) for the private key that supposedly decrypts any file encrypted with NotPetya.

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:


Avast (CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)
Avira (CVE-2017-6417)
Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)
Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)
Comodo<span class="highlight-match">
ESET
</span>F-Secure
Kaspersky
Malwarebytes
McAfee
Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

What could be more exciting for hackers than exploiting a vulnerability in a widely used software without having to struggle too much?

One such easy-to-exploit, but critical vulnerability has been discovered in<span class="highlight-match"> ESET'</span>s antivirus software that could allow any unauthenticated attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code with root privileges on a Mac system.

The critical security flaw, tracked as CVE-2016-9892, in ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6 for macOS was discovered by Google Security Team's researchers Jason Geffner and Jan Bee at the beginning of November 2016.

As detailed in the full disclosure, all a hacker needs to get root-level remote code execution on a Mac computer is to intercept the ESET antivirus package's connection to its backend servers using a self-signed HTTPS certificate, put himself in as a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker, and exploit an XML library flaw.

The actual issue was related to a service named esets_daemon, which runs as root. The service is statically linked with an outdated version of the POCO XML parser library, version 1.4.6p1 released in March 2013.

This POCO version is based on a version of the Expat XML parser library version 2.0.1 from 2007, which is affected by a publicly known XML parsing vulnerability (CVE-2016-0718) that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via malicious XML content.

Now, when esets_daemon sent a request to https://edf.eset.com/edf during activation of the ESET Endpoint Antivirus product, an MITM attacker can intercept the request to deliver a malformed XML document using a self-signed HTTPS certificate.

This event triggers the CVE-2016-0718 flaw that executes the malicious code with root privileges when esets_daemon parsed the XML content.

This attack was possible because the ESET antivirus did not validate the web server's certificate.

Here's what the duo explain:

"Vulnerable versions of ESET Endpoint Antivirus 6 are statically linked with an outdated XML parsing library and do not perform proper server authentication, allowing for remote unauthenticated attackers to perform arbitrary code execution as root on vulnerable clients."

Now since the hacker controls the connection, they can send malicious content to the Mac computer in order to hijack the XML parser and execute code as root.

The Google researchers have also released the proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code, which only shows how the ESET antivirus app can be used to cause a crash.

ESET addressed this vulnerability on February 21 by upgrading the POCO parsing library and by configuring its product to verify SSL certificates.

The patch is made available in the release of version 6.4.168.0 of ESET Endpoint Antivirus for macOS. So, make sure your antivirus package is patched up to date.

Are you sure the version of WhatsApp, or Skype, or VLC Player installed on your device is legitimate?

Security researchers have discovered that legitimate downloads of several popular applications including WhatsApp, Skype, VLC Player and WinRAR have reportedly been compromised at the ISP level to distribute the infamous FinFisher spyware also known as FinSpy.

FinSpy is a highly secret surveillance tool that has previously been associated with British company Gamma Group, a company that legally sells surveillance and espionage software to government agencies across the world.

The spyware has extensive spying capabilities on an infected computer, including secretly conducting live surveillance by turning ON its webcams and microphones, recording everything the victim types with a keylogger, intercepting Skype calls, and exfiltration of files.

In order to get into a target's machine, FinFisher usually uses various attack vectors, including spear phishing, manual installation with physical access to the device, zero-day exploits, and watering hole attacks.


Your ISP May Be Helping Hackers To Spy On You

However, a new report published today by<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>claimed that its researchers had discovered new surveillance campaigns utilizing new variants of FinFisher in seven countries, which comes bundled with a legitimate application.


But how is this¬†happening? Attackers are targeting victims using a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, where the internet service providers (ISP) are most likely operating as the "middle man"‚Äîbundling legitimate software downloads with FinFisher.

"We have seen this vector being used in two of the countries in which ESET systems detected the latest FinFisher spyware (in the five remaining countries, the campaigns have relied on traditional infection vectors)," the researchers say.
Previously published documents by WikiLeaks also indicated that the FinFisher maker also offered a tool called "FinFly ISP," which is supposed to be deployed on ISP level with capabilities necessary for performing such a MitM attack.

Also, the infection technique (using the HTTP 307 redirect) was implemented in the same way in the two affected countries ESET discovered being targeted by the new variants of FinFisher. However, the firm did not name the affected countries "as not to put anyone in danger."

Another fact which supports the ISP-level MitM attack is that all affected targets identified by the researchers within a country were using the same ISP.

"Finally, the very same redirection method and format have been used for internet content filtering by internet service providers in at least one of the affected countries," the ESET report reads.
The popular applications targeted by the new variants of FinFisher include WhatsApp, Skype, VLC Player, Avast and WinRAR, and the ESET researchers said, "virtually any application could be misused in this way."


Here's How The Attack Works:

When the target users search for one of the affected applications on legitimate websites and click on its download link, their browser is served a modified URL, which redirects victims to a trojanized installation package hosted on the attacker's server.

This results in the installation of a version of the intended legitimate application bundled with the surveillance tool.

"The redirection is achieved by the legitimate download link being replaced by a malicious one," the researchers say. "The malicious link is delivered to the user‚Äôs browser via an HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect status response code indicating that the requested content has been temporarily moved to a new URL."
This whole redirection process, according to researchers, is "invisible to the naked eye" and occurs without user's knowledge.


FinFisher Utilizing a Whole Lot of New Tricks

The new tricks employed by the latest version of FinFisher kept it from being spotted by the researchers.

The researchers also note that the latest version of FinFisher received several technical improvements in terms of stealthiness, including the use of custom code virtualization to protect the majority of its components like the kernel-mode driver.

It also makes use of anti-disassembly tricks, and numerous anti-sandboxing, anti-debugging, anti-virtualization and anti-emulation tricks, aiming at compromising end-to-end encryption software and known privacy tools.

One such secure messaging application, called Threema, was discovered by the researchers while they were analyzing the recent campaigns.

"FinFisher spyware masqueraded as an executable file named "Threema." Such a file could be used to target privacy-concerned users, as the legitimate Threema application provides secure instant messaging with end-to-end encryption," the researchers say.¬†

"Ironically, getting tricked into downloading and running the infected file would result in the privacy-seeking user being spied upon."
Gamma Group has not yet responded to the ESET report.

If you have visited any popular mainstream website over the past two months, your computer may have been infected ‚Äî Thanks to a new exploit kit discovered by security researchers.

Researchers from antivirus provider<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>released a report on Tuesday stating that they have discovered an exploit kit, dubbed Stegano, hiding malicious code in the pixels of banner advertisements that are currently in rotation on several high profile news websites.

Stegano originally dates back to 2014, but since early October this year, cyber crooks had managed to get the malicious ads displayed on a variety of unnamed reputable news websites, each with Millions of daily visitors.

Stegano derived from the word Steganography, which is a technique of hiding messages and content inside a digital graphic image, making the content impossible to spot with the naked eye.

In this particular malvertising campaign, operators hide malicious code inside transparent PNG image's Alpha Channel, which defines the transparency of each pixel, by altering the transparency value of several pixels.

The malvertising campaign operators then packed the altered image as an advertisement and managed to display those malicious ads on several high-profile websites.

According to the researchers, the malicious ads promote applications called "Browser Defense" and "Broxu," and the methodology makes it tough for ad networks to detect.


Here's How the Stegano Attack Works:

Once a user visits a site hosting malicious advertisement, the malicious script embedded in the ad reports information about the victim's computer to the attacker's remote server without any user interaction.

The malicious code then uses the CVE-2016-0162 vulnerability in Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) browser in order to scan the target computer to see if it is running on a malware analyst's machine.

After verifying the targeted browser, the malicious script redirects the browser to a website that hosts Flash Player exploits for three now-patched Adobe Flash vulnerabilities: CVE-2015-8651, CVE-2016-1019, and CVE-2016-4117.

"Upon successful exploitation, the executed shell code collects information on installed security products and performs ‚Äì as paranoid as the cybercriminals behind this attack ‚Äì yet another check to verify that it is not being monitored," ESET researchers wrote in a blog post. "If results are favorable, it will attempt to download the encrypted payload from the same server again, disguised as a gif image."
When downloaded to the victim's computer, the encrypted payload is then decrypted and launched via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe in Microsoft Windows.


Just Visit a Site, and You'll be Hacked in Just 2-3 Sec

Below is an ESET infographic that explains the working of Stegano's exploit attack:



All the above operations execute automatically without any user interactions and takes place in the span of just 2-3 seconds.

So far, the Stegano exploit kit has pushed various trojan downloaders, the Ursnif and Ramnit banking trojans, backdoors, spyware, and file stealers.

The Stegano exploit kit was initially used in 2014 to target people in the Netherlands, and then in 2015, moved on to residents in the Czech Republic. The latest attack campaign is targeting people in Canada, the UK, Australia, Spain, and Italy.

The best way to protect yourself against any malvertising campaign is always to make sure you are running updated software and apps. Also use reputed antivirus software that can detect such threats before they infect your system.

The Shadow Brokers who previously stole and leaked a portion of the NSA hacking tools and exploits is back with a Bang!

The hacking group is now selling another package of hacking tools, ‚ÄúEquation Group Windows Warez,‚Äù which includes Windows exploits and antivirus bypass tools, stolen from the NSA-linked hacking unit, The Equation Group.

For those unfamiliar with the topic, The Shadow Brokers is a notorious group of black-hat hackers who, in August 2016, leaked exploits, security vulnerabilities, and "powerful espionage tools" created by The Equation Group.

On Saturday, the Shadow Brokers posted a message on their ZeroNet based website, announcing the sale of the entire "Windows Warez" collection for 750 Bitcoin (around US$678,630).

The data dump contains many windows hacking tools, categorized as following:

Fuzzing tools (used to discover errors and security loopholes)
Exploit Framework
Network Implants
Remote Administration Tools (RAT)
Remote Code Execution Exploits for IIS, RDP, RPC, SMB Protocols (Some Zero-Days)
SMB BackDoor (Implant)

Interestingly, the Remote Administration Tool (RAT) "DanderSpritz" included in the list is the one previously leaked in the NSA's documents revealed by Edward Snowden.

Besides this, malware researcher Jacob Williams analyzed the archive of "screenshots and output of the find command across the dump" provided by the hacker as an evidence of legitimacy and estimated that the tools may also include a Fully Undetectable Malware (FUD) toolkit.


The FUD toolkit might have an ability to "evade/bypass personal security products," such as Avira, Avast, Dr.Web,<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>Antivirus, Comodo, McAfee Antivirus, Microsoft Essential, Panda, Symantec, Trend Micro and Kaspersky Antivirus.

The buyers can purchase the entire database of hacking tools that The Equation Group used against various countries to expand its espionage operations.

In August, the Shadow Brokers announced an auction attempting to sell the complete set of tools to the highest bidder, but the group canceled their auction in October due to little or no response on their public sale.

But since this time the group has made Windows hacking tools up for sale, the chances are that hackers and espionage groups would be interested in buying these hacking tools.

Last December, a cyber attack on Ukrainian Electric power grid caused the power outage in the northern part of Kiev ‚Äî the country's capital ‚Äî and surrounding areas, causing a blackout for tens of thousands of citizens for an hour and fifteen minutes around midnight.

Now, security researchers have discovered the culprit behind those cyber attacks on the Ukrainian industrial control systems.

Slovakia-based security software maker<span class="highlight-match"> ESET </span>and US critical infrastructure security firm Dragos Inc. say they have discovered a new dangerous piece of malware in the wild that targets critical industrial control systems and is capable of causing blackouts.

Dubbed "Industroyer" or "CrashOverRide," the grid-sabotaging malware was likely to be used in the December 2016 cyber attack against Ukrainian electric utility Ukrenergo, which the security firms say represents a dangerous advancement in critical infrastructure hacking.

According to the researchers, CrashOverRide is the biggest threat designed to disrupt industrial control systems, after Stuxnet ‚Äî the first malware allegedly developed by the US and Israel to sabotage the Iranian nuclear facilities in 2009.


This Malware Does Not Exploit Any Software Flaw



Unlike Stuxnet worm, the CrashOverRide malware does not exploit any "zero-day" software vulnerabilities to do its malicious activities; instead, it relies on four industrial communication protocols used worldwide in power supply infrastructure, transportation control systems, and other critical infrastructure systems.

The CrashOverRide malware can control electricity substation' switches and circuit breakers, designed decades ago, allowing an attacker to simply turning off power distribution, cascading failures and causing more severe damage to equipment.

Industroyer malware is a backdoor that first installs four payload components to take control of switches and circuit breakers; and then connects to a remote command-and-control server to receive commands from the attackers.

"Industroyer payloads show the authors' in-depth knowledge and understanding of industrial control systems." ESET researchers explain.

"The malware contains a few more features that are designed to enable it to remain under the radar, to ensure the malware's persistence, and to wipe all traces of itself after it has done its job."
Since there have been four malware discovered in the wild to date that target industrial control systems, including Stuxnet, Havex, BlackEnergy, and CrashOverRide; Stuxnet and CrashOverRide were designed only for sabotage, while BlackEnergy and Havex were meant for conducting espionage.

"The functionality in the CRASHOVERRIDE framework serves no espionage purpose and the only real feature of the malware is for attacks which would lead to electric outages," reads Dragos analysis [PDF] of the malware.


Malware Can Cause Wider and Longer-Lasting Blackouts

The analysis of the malware suggests CrashOverRide could cause power outages far more widespread, sophisticated and longer lasting than the one Ukraine suffered last December.

Dragos CEO Robert M. Lee said the CrashOverRide malware is capable of causing power outages that can last up to a few days in portions of a country's electric grid, but it is not capable enough to bring down the entire grid of a nation.


The malware includes interchangeable, plug-in components that could allow CrashOverRide to be altered to different electric power utilities or even launched simultaneous attacks on multiple targets.

"CrashOverRide is not unique to any particular vendor or configuration and instead leverages knowledge of grid operations and network communications to cause impact; in that way, it can be immediately re-purposed in Europe and portions of the Middle East and Asia," Dragos' paper reads.¬†

"CrashOverRide is extensible and with a small amount of tailoring such as the inclusion of a DNP3 [Distributed Network Protocol 3]¬†protocol stack would also be effective in the North American grid."
According to the researchers, the malware can be modified to target other types of critical infrastructure, like transportation, gas lines, or water facilities, as well with additional protocol modules.

The security firms have already alerted government authorities and power grid companies about the dangerous threat, along with some advises that could help them to defend against this threat.

The security firms already argued that the 2016 power outage was likely caused by the same group of hackers who caused 2015 blackout ‚Äî Sandworm, a state-sponsored hacking group believed to be from Russia.

Dragos tracked the perpetrators behind CrashOverRide as Electrum and assessed "with high confidence through confidential sources that Electrum has direct ties to the Sandworm team."

The security firms have already alerted government authorities and power grid companies about the dangerous threat, along with some advises that could help them to defend against this threat.

Cyber criminals are becoming more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day. They have now shifted from traditional to more clandestine techniques that come with limitless attack vectors and are harder to detect.

Security researchers have discovered that one of the most dangerous Android banking Trojan families has now been modified to add a keylogger to its recent strain, giving attackers yet another way to steal victims sensitive data.

Kaspersky Lab's Senior malware analyst Roman Unuchek spotted a new variant of the well-known Android banking Trojan, dubbed Svpeng, in the mid of last month with a new keylogger feature, which takes advantage of Android's Accessibility Services.

Trojan Exploits 'Accessibility Services' to Add Keylogger
Yes, the keylogger added in the new version of Svpeng takes advantage of Accessibility Services ‚Äî an Android feature that provides users alternative ways to interact with their smartphone devices.

This change makes the Svpeng Trojan able not only to steal entered text from other apps installed on the device and log all keystrokes, but also to grant itself more permissions and rights to prevent victims from uninstalling the Trojan.

In November last year, the Svpeng banking trojan infected over 318,000 Android devices across the world over the span of only two months with the help of Google AdSense advertisements that was abused to spread the malicious banking Trojan.

Over a month ago, researchers also discovered another attack taking advantage of Android's Accessibility Services, called Cloak and Dagger attack, which allows hackers to silently take full control of the infected devices and steal private data.

If You Are Russian, You Are Safe!
Although the new variant of the Svpeng malware is not yet widely deployed, the malware has already hit users in 23 countries over the course of a week, which include Russia, Germany, Turkey, Poland, and France.

But what's worth noticing is that, even though most infected users are from Russia, the new variant of Svpeng Trojan doesn't perform malicious actions on those devices.

According to Unuchek, after infecting the device, the Trojan first checks the device's language. If the language is Russian, the malware prevents further malicious tasks‚Äîthis suggests the criminal group behind this malware is Russian, who are avoiding to violate Russian laws by hacking locals.

How 'Svpeng' Trojan Steals Your Money
Unuchek says the latest version of Svpeng he spotted in July was being distributed through malicious websites that disguised as a fake Flash Player.

Once installed, as I have mentioned above, the malware first checks for the device language and, if the language is not Russian, asks the device to use Accessibility Services, which opens the infected device to a number of dangerous attacks.

With having access to Accessibility Services, the Trojan grants itself device administrator rights, displays an overlay on the top of legitimate apps, installs itself as a default SMS app, and grants itself some dynamic permissions, such as the ability to make calls, send and receive SMS, and read contacts.

Additionally, using its newly-gained administrative capabilities, the Trojan can block every attempt of victims to remove device administrator rights‚Äîthereby preventing the uninstallation of the malware.

Using accessibility services, Svpeng gains access to the inner working of other apps on the device, allowing the Trojan to steal text entered on other apps and take screenshots every time the victim presses a button on the keyboard, and other available data.
"Some apps, mainly banking ones, do not allow screenshots to be taken when they are on top. In such cases, the Trojan has another option to steal data ‚Äì it draws its phishing window over the attacked app," Unuchek says.¬†"It is interesting that, in order to find out which app is on top, it uses accessibility services too."All the stolen information is then uploaded to the attackers' command and control (C&C) server. As part of his research, Unuchek said he managed to intercept an encrypted configuration file from the malware's C&C server.

Decrypting the file helped him find out some of the websites and apps that Svpeng targets, as well as help him obtain a URL with phishing pages for both the PayPal and eBay mobile apps, along with links for banking apps from the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Australia, France, Poland, and Singapore.

Besides URLs, the file also allows the malware to receive various commands from the C&C server, which includes sending SMS, collecting information such as contacts, installed apps and call logs, opening the malicious link, gathering all SMS from the device, and stealing incoming SMS.

Lukas Stefanko, malware researcher at<span class="highlight-match"> ESET,</span> has shared a video (given below) with The Hacker News, demonstrating the working of this malware.


The Evolution of 'Svpeng' Android Banking Malware
Researchers at Kaspersky Lab initially discovered the Svpeng Android banking malware trojan back in 2013, with primary capability‚ÄîPhishing.

Back in 2014, the malware was then modified to add a ransomware component that locked victim's device (by FBI because they visited sites containing pornography) and demanded $500 from users.

The malware was among the first to begin attacking SMS banking, use phishing web pages to overlay other apps in an effort to steal banking credentials and to block devices and demand money.

In 2016, cyber criminals were actively distributing Svpeng via Google AdSense using a vulnerability in the Chrome web browser, and now abusing Accessibility Services, which possibly makes Svpeng the most dangerous mobile banking malware family to date that can steal¬†almost anything‚Äîfrom your Facebook credentials to your credit cards and bank accounts.

How to Protect Your Smartphone From Hackers
With just Accessibility Services, this banking Trojan gains all necessary permissions and rights to steal lots of data from the infected devices.

The malicious techniques of the Svpeng malware even work on fully-updated Android devices with the latest Android version and all security updates installed, so it is little users can do in order to protect themselves.

There are standard protection measures you need to follow to remain unaffected:

Always stick to trusted sources, like Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, but only from trusted and verified developers.
Most importantly, verify app permissions before installing apps. If any app is asking more than what it is meant for, just do not install it.
Do not download apps from third party sources, as most often such malware spreads via untrusted third-parties.
Avoid unknown and unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots and Keep your Wi-Fi turned OFF when not in use.
Never click on links provided in an SMS, MMS or email. Even if the email looks legit, go directly to the website of origin and verify any possible updates.
Install a good antivirus app that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device, and always keep the app up-to-date.

Next time when you see an advertisement of your favorite pair of shoes on any website, even if it is legitimate, just DO NOT CLICK ON IT.

‚Ä¶Because that advertising could infect you in such a way that not just your system, but every device connected to your network would get affected.

A few days ago, we reported about a new exploit kit, dubbed Stegano, that hides malicious code in the pixels of banner advertisements rotating on several high profile news websites.

Now, researchers have discovered that attackers are targeting online users with an exploit kit called DNSChanger that is being distributed via advertisements that hide malicious code in image data.

Remember DNSChanger? Yes, the same malware that infected millions of computers across the world in 2012.

DNSChanger works by changing DNS server entries in infected computers to point to malicious servers under the control of the attackers, rather than the DNS servers provided by any ISP or organization.

So, whenever a user of an infected system looked up a website on the Internet (say, facebook.com), the malicious DNS server tells you to go to, say, a phishing site. Attackers could also inject ads, redirect search results, or attempt to install drive-by downloads.

The most worrisome part is that hackers have combined both threats in their recent widespread malvertising campaign, where DNSChanger malware is being spread using Stegno technique, and once it hit your system, instead of infecting your PC, it takes control of your unsecured routers.

Researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint </span>have discovered this unique DNSChanger exploit kit on more than 166 router models. The kit is unique because the malware in it does not target browsers, rather it targets routers that run unpatched firmware or are secured with weak admin passwords.


Here's How the Attack Works:


Firstly, the ads on mainstream websites hiding malicious code in image data redirects victims to web pages hosting the DNSChanger exploit kit. The exploit kit then targets unsecured routers.

Once the router is compromised, the DNSChanger malware configures itself to use an attacker-controlled DNS server, causing most computers and devices on the network to visit malicious servers, rather than those corresponding to their official domain.

Those ads containing malicious JavaScript code reveals a user's local IP address by triggering a WebRTC request (the web communication protocol) to a Mozilla STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) server.

STUN server then send a ping back containing the IP address and port of the client. If the target's IP address is within a targeted range, the target receives a fake ad hiding exploit code in the metadata of a PNG image.

The malicious code eventually redirects the visitor to a web page hosting DNSChanger, which uses the Chrome browser for Windows and Android to serve a second image concealed with the router exploit code.


"This attack is determined by the particular router model that is detected during the reconnaissance phase," a Proofpoint researcher wrote in a blog post. "If there is no known exploit, the attack will attempt to use default credentials."


List of Routers Affected

The attack then cloaks traffic and compares the accessed router against 166 fingerprints used to determine if a target is using vulnerable router model. According to researchers, some of the vulnerable routers include:


D-Link DSL-2740R
NetGear WNDR3400v3 (and likely other models in this series)
Netgear R6200
COMTREND ADSL Router CT-5367 C01_R12
Pirelli ADSL2/2+ Wireless Router P.DGA4001N


It is not clear at the moment that how many people have been exposed to the malicious ads or how long the campaign has been running, but Proofpoint said the attackers behind the campaign have previously been responsible for infecting more than 1 million people a day.

Proofpoint did not disclose the¬†name of any ad network or website displaying the malicious advertisements.

Users are advised to ensure that their routers are running the latest version of the firmware and are protected with a strong password. They can also disable remote administration, change its default local IP address, and hardcode a trusted DNS server into the operating system network settings.

Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment as it takes a monstrous amount of computing power, and thus hackers have started using malware that steals computing resources of computers it hijacks to make lots of dollars in digital currency.

Security researchers at security firm ESET have spotted one such malware that infected hundreds of Windows web servers with a malicious cryptocurrency miner and helped cybercriminals made more than $63,000 worth of Monero (XMR) in just three months.

According to a report published by ESET today, cybercriminals only made modifications to legitimate open source Monero mining software and exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft IIS 6.0 to secretly install the miner on unpatched Windows servers.

Although ESET's investigation does not identify the attackers, it reports that the attackers have been infecting unpatched Windows web servers with the cryptocurrency miner since at least May 2017 to mine 'Monero,' a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency.

The vulnerability (CVE-2017-7269) exploited by the attackers was discovered in March 2017 by Zhiniang Peng and Chen Wu and resides in the WebDAV service of Microsoft IIS version 6.0‚Äîthe web server in Windows Server 2003 R2.

Therefore, hackers are only targeting unpatched machines running Windows Server 2003 to make them part of a botnet, which has already helped them made over $63,000 worth of Monero.



Since the vulnerability is on a web server, which is meant to be visible from the internet, it can be accessed and exploited by anyone. You can learn more about the vulnerability here.

The newly discovered malware mines Monero that has a total market valuation of about $1.4 billion, which is far behind Bitcoin in market capitalisation, but cybercriminals‚Äô love for Monero is due to its focus on privacy.

Unlike Bitcoin, Monero offers untraceable transactions and is anonymous cryptocurrency in the world today.

Another reason of hackers favouring Monero is that it uses a proof-of-work algorithm called CryptoNight, which suits computer or server CPUs and GPUs, while Bitcoin mining requires specific mining hardware.

However, this is not the first time when analysts have spotted such malware mining Monero by stealing computing resources of compromised computers.

In mid-May,<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint </span>researcher Kafeine discovered cryptocurrency mining malware, called 'Adylkuzz,' which was using EternalBlue exploit‚Äîcreated by the NSA and dumped last month by the Shadow Brokers in April‚Äîto infect unpatched Windows systems to mine Monero.

A week before that, GuardiCore researchers discovered a new botnet malware, dubbed BondNet, that was also infecting Windows systems, with a combination of techniques, for primarily mining Monero.

Another day, another creepy malware for Android users!

Security Researchers have uncovered a new Android malware targeting your devices, but this time instead of attacking the device directly, the malware takes control over the WiFi router to which your device is connected to and then hijacks the web traffic passing through it.

Dubbed "Switcher," the new Android malware, discovered by researchers at Kaspersky Lab, hacks the wireless routers and changes their DNS settings to redirect traffic to malicious websites.

Over a week ago,<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint </span>researchers discovered similar attack targeting PCs, but instead of infecting the target's machines, the Stegano exploit kit takes control over the local WiFi routers the infected device is connected to.


Switcher Malware carries out Brute-Force attack against Routers

Hackers are currently distributing the Switcher trojan by disguising itself as an Android app for the Chinese search engine Baidu (com.baidu.com), and as a Chinese app for sharing public and private Wi-Fi network details (com.snda.wifilocating).

Once victim installs one of these malicious apps, the Switcher malware attempts to log in to the WiFi router the victim's Android device is connected to by carrying out a brute-force attack on the router's admin web interface with a set of a predefined dictionary (list) of usernames and passwords.

"With the help of JavaScript [Switcher] tries to login using different combinations of logins and passwords," mobile security expert Nikita Buchka of Kaspersky Lab says in a blog post published today.¬†

"Judging by the hard coded names of input fields and the structures of the HTML documents that the trojan tries to access, the JavaScript code used will work only on web interfaces of TP-LINK Wi-Fi routers."

Switcher Malware Infects Routers via DNS Hijacking


Once accessed web administration interface, the Switcher trojan replaces the router's primary and secondary DNS servers with IP addresses pointing to malicious DNS servers controlled by the attackers.

Researchers said Switcher had used three different IP addresses ‚Äì 101.200.147.153, 112.33.13.11 and 120.76.249.59 ‚Äì as the primary DNS record, one is the default one while the other two are set for specific internet service providers.

Due to change in router's DNS settings, all the traffic gets redirected to malicious websites hosted on attackers own servers, instead of the legitimate site the victim is trying to access.

"The Trojan targets the entire network, exposing all its users, whether individuals or businesses, to a wide range of attacks ‚Äì from phishing to secondary infection," the post reads.

"A successful attack can be hard to detect and even harder to shift: the new settings can survive a router reboot, and even if the rogue DNS is disabled, the secondary DNS server is on hand to carry on."
Researchers were able to access the attacker‚Äôs command and control servers and found that the Switcher malware Trojan has compromised almost 1,300 routers, mainly in China and hijacked traffic within those networks.


The Bottom Line

Android users are required to download applications only from official Google's Play Store.

While downloading apps from third parties do not always end up with malware or viruses, it certainly ups the risk. So, it is the best way to avoid any malware compromising your device and the networks it accesses.

You can also go to Settings ‚Üí Security and make sure "Unknown sources" option is turned off.

Moreover, Android users should also change their router's default login and passwords so that nasty malware like Switcher or Mirai, can not compromise their routers using a brute-force attack.

The malicious scam campaign, "The 'HoeflerText' font wasn't found," is back, which was previously targeting Google Chrome users to trick them into installing Spora ransomware on their computers.

This time the campaign has been re-designed to target Mozilla Firefox users with a banking trojan, called Zeus Panda, says¬†Kafeine, a security researcher at<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint.</span>

Interestingly, the attackers behind this new campaign are so stupid that they forgot to change the name of the font, i.e. HoeflerText, due to which can be easily spotted.

As I previously warned ‚Äî Next time when you accidentally land up on a suspicious website with jumbled content prompting to update the Firefox or Chrome font pack by downloading a missing text font to read the article‚Ä¶ Just don't download it. It's obviously a trap.

Just like the previous one, the latest Firefox 'HoeflerText font wasn't found scam is also very convincing and easy to fall for. 

The attack initiates with an alert message, which states that "The 'HoeflerText' font was not found," asking Firefox users to update their "Mozilla Font Pack."

Once clicked, it downloads a ZIP file (Mozilla_Font_v7.87.zip) on the victim‚Äôs system, containing a JavaScript file. Meanwhile, the screen will display a set of instructions, asking victims to run the JS file in order to install the missing "Mozilla Font Pack." 

If the victims turned out to be so stupid that they run the JS file themselves, as instructed, the program will download the malware payload (.exe) from a remote server and then runs it automatically, injecting the Zeus Panda banking Trojan into the infected systems.

Panda is an online banking trojan that was initially found to be targeting banks in Europe and North America early last year and then started spreading itself to Brazil through at least three different exploit kits, including Angler, Nuclear, and Neutrino.

Once it infects a system, the Zeus Panda banking trojan contacts its command and control (C&C) server to send the infected device information, including a list of installed antivirus and firewall products.

Panda focuses on stealing banking credentials from users, as well as those of bitcoin exchanges, payment card services and online payments providers, prepaid cards, airline loyalty programs and online betting accounts, to name a few.

To protect yourself from such scams, always exercise caution when downloading anything from the Internet onto your computers. Moreover, keep your antivirus up-to-date and do not ever fall for scam asking you to update your Mozilla or Chrome font pack, as it already comes with everything you need.

A security researcher has just discovered a stealthy cryptocurrency-mining malware that was also using Windows SMB vulnerability at least two weeks before the outbreak of WannaCry ransomware attacks.

According to Kafeine, a security researcher at<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint,</span> another group of cyber criminals was using the same EternalBlue exploit, created by the NSA and dumped last month by the Shadow Brokers, to infect hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide with a cryptocurrency mining malware called 'Adylkuzz.'

This malicious campaign went unnoticed for weeks because unlike WannaCry, this malware does not install ransomware or notify victims, but instead, it quietly infects unpatched computers with malware that only mine 'Monero,' a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency.


This Malware Saves Computers From Getting Hacked By WannaCry

The Researcher believes Adylkuzz malware attack could be larger in scale than WannaCry ransomware attack because it has been designed to block SMB ports of a targeted computer after hijacking it.

In other words, Adylkuzz malware infects unpatched computers and then closes SMB ports to prevent them from further infections, which may have indirectly saved hundreds of thousand of computers from getting hacked by WannaCry ransomware as well.

Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment as it requires an enormous amount of computing power, but the Adylkuzz cryptocurrency-mining malware makes it easier for cybercriminals by allowing them to utilize computing resources of compromised systems and makes lots and lots of dollars.

"Once infected through use of the EternalBlue exploit, the cryptocurrency miner Adylkuzz is installed and used to generate cybercash for the attackers," said Robert Holmes, vice president of products at Proofpoint.
One Monero is currently valued at around US$26.77.

"While an individual laptop may generate only a few dollars per week, collectively the network of compromised computers appears to be generating five-figure payouts daily," the researchers added.
According to Proofpoint, tens of thousands of computers across the world have been infected by the Adylkuzz malware.

Despite people's efforts to patch their systems to prevent themselves from the WannaCry menace, Proofpoint believes the Adylkuzz attack is still growing and targeting Windows machines.

Last week, in a separate research, GuardiCore researchers uncovered a new botnet malware, dubbed BondNet, that was also infecting Windows machines worldwide, with a combination of techniques, for mining cryptocurrencies ‚Äî primarily Monero, but also ByteCoin, RieCoin, and ZCash.

If this isn't enough, you'll find yourself worry after knowing that the hacking group, Shadow Brokers, who last month leaked the Windows SMB exploit, is back, promising to release more zero-days¬†vulnerabilities and exploits starting from June.

So, the best key to keeping yourself safe is that instead of worrying about your devices, just patch them with the latest updates and follow some basic security tips that I have mentioned in my previous article about how to disable SMB and prevent your machines from WannaCry, cryptocurrency mining malware, and other malware.

Cybercrime has continued to evolve and today exists in a highly organised form.

Cybercrime has increasingly been commercialised, and itself become big business by renting out an expanded range of hacking tools and technologies, from exploit kits to ransomware, to help anyone build threats and launch attacks.

In past few years, we have witnessed the increase in the popularity of malware-as-a-service (MaaS), which is today a prosperous business on the underground black market that offers an array of services, including ransomware-as-a-service, DDoS-as-a-service, phishing-as-a-service, and much more.

Two such services have recently been spotted by two separate group of researchers, which we have detailed in this article.


Ovidiy Stealer ‚Äî¬†$7 Password-Stealing Malware For Everyone


A new credential stealing malware that targets primarily web browsers is being marketed at Russian-speaking web forums for as cheap as $7, allowing anyone with even little technical knowledge to hack as many computers as they want.

Dubbed Ovidiy Stealer, the malware was initially appeared just last month but is being regularly updated by its Russian-speaking authors and actively adopted by cyber criminals.

The Ovidiy Stealer malware currently has several versions in the wild, targeting people around the world, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, India, and Russia, according to security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint,</span> who analysed the malware.

What's surprising is the Ovidiy Stealer's cost.

A single customizable build of this lightweight, easy-to-use, and effective malware product only costs between 450 and 750 Rubles (nearly $7 and $13), according to security researchers at Proofpoint, who uncovered and analysed the malware.

Despite its low price, the malware build executables are encrypted, which make them difficult to detect and analyse, though the report also notes that some antivirus products are detecting Ovidiy Stealer with its behaviour.

Written in .NET, the credentials stealer malware comes with the ability to target multiple applications and browsers, including Google Chrome, Opera, FileZilla, Amigo, Kometa, Torch, and Orbitum, but buyers can purchase a version that only works on a single browser.

The malware is being distributed via a number of methods, including malicious email attachments, malicious links to a download, fake software or tools offered on various file-hosting websites, and even within software packages.

Ovidiy Stealer itself is not very powerful and advanced, as it does not include any persistence mechanism that allows the malware to run after a reboot, but it has the potential to become widespread.

Ovidiy Stealer uses SSL/TLS connection for secure communication with the command and control server, which is hosted on a Russian domain ‚Äî the same domain used to market and sell the malware.

"A lightweight, easy-to-use, and effective product coupled with frequent updates and a stable support system give Ovidiy Stealer the potential to become a much more widespread threat," the report concluded.¬†

"Ovidiy Stealer highlights the manner in the cybercrime marketplace drives innovation and new entrants and challenges organisations that must keep pace with the latest threats to their users, their data, and their systems."


Hackshit ‚Äî Easier Phishing Than Ever Before!


Another crimeware-as-a-service uncovered by researchers from Netskope Threat Research Labs detailed a Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform that offers low cost, "automated solution for the beginner scammers," allowing them to trick people into handing over their credentials.

Dubbed Hackshit, the PhaaS platform attracts new subscribers by offering them free trial accounts to review their limited set of hacking tutorials and tricks to make easy money.

"The marketplace is a portal that offers services to purchase and sell for carrying out the phishing attacks," Netskope researcher Ashwin Vamshi says.¬†

"The attacker then generates a phished page from the page/generator link and logs into the email account of the compromised victim, views all the contacts and sends an email embedded with the phished link."
Hackshit allows wannabe hackers (subscribers) to generate their unique phishing pages for several services, including Yahoo, Facebook, and Google's Gmail.

Researchers noted that the phishing pages use data URI scheme to serve base64 encoded content from "a secure HTTPS websites with ".moe" top level domain (TLD) to evade traditional scanners."

"Based on one of the video tutorials we observed, the attacker purchases site login accounts of compromised victim from the marketplace using Perfect Money or bitcoins," the researcher says.
Moreover, Hackshit website is using an SSL certificate issued by Let's Encrypt ‚Äî the open certificate authority (CA) that offers free SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security) certificates for web servers, making HTTPS implementation easier for everyone.

These crimeware-as-a-service poses a new security challenge because it not only allows malicious actors to leverage other cybercriminals' resources to conduct attacks, but also bringing wannabe hackers into the world of cybercrime.

If you are a regular reader of The Hacker News, you might be aware of an ongoing cyber attack ‚Äî detected in the wild by McAfee and FireEye ‚Äî that silently installs malware on fully-patched computers by exploiting an unpatched Microsoft Word vulnerability in all current versions of Microsoft Office.

Now, according to security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint,</span> the operators of the Dridex malware started exploiting the unpatched Microsoft Word vulnerability to spread a version of their infamous Dridex banking trojan.

Dridex is currently one of the most dangerous banking trojans on the Internet that exhibits the typical behavior of monitoring a victim's traffic to bank sites by infiltrating PCs and stealing victim's online banking credentials and financial data.

The Dridex actors usually relied on macro-laden Word files to distribute the malware through spam messages or emails.

However, this is the first time when researchers found the Dridex operators using an unpatched zero-day flaw in Microsoft Word for distributing their banking trojan.



According to a blog post published Monday night by Proofpoint, the latest Dridex spam campaign is delivering Word documents weaponized with this zero-day to millions of recipients across several organizations, including banks primarily located in Australia.

"Emails in this campaign used an attached Microsoft Word RTF (Rich Text Format) document. Messages purported to be from "[device]@[recipient's domain]." [Device] may be "copier", "documents", "noreply", "no-reply", or "scanner"," Proofpoint researchers say.¬†


"The subject line in all cases read "Scan Data" and included attachments named "Scan_123456.doc" or "Scan_123456.pdf", where "123456" was replaced with random digits...the spoofed email domains and the common practice of emailing digitized versions of documents make the lures fairly convincing."
As we reported on Saturday, this zero-day flaw is severe because it gives hackers power to bypass most exploit mitigations developed by Microsoft, and unlike past Word exploits seen in the wild, it doesn't require victims to enable Macros.

Moreover, given the danger of Dridex ‚Äì also known as Bugat and Cridex ‚Äì banking trojan, people are strongly advised not to open Word documents attached to an email from anyone, even if you know the sender until Microsoft releases a patch.


Microsoft knew of the flaw very long ago

According to researchers at McAfee and FireEye, Microsoft has known of the remote code flaw since January and could release a patch for the vulnerability today, as part of its regular Patch Tuesday routine.

However, an independent security researcher Ryan Hanson claimed that he discovered this 0-day, along with the two other flaws, in July and reported it to Microsoft in October 2016.

"The initial discovery was in July, which was followed up by additional research and the identification of a protected view bypass vulnerability. Those two bugs and an additional Outlook bug were submitted to MS in October," Hanson told The Hacker News.¬†

"There may very well be additional HTA related vectors in Office, but based on the detail provided by McAfee, the vulnerability they've identified functions exactly like the one I disclosed. The only difference I see is the VBScript payload, since my payload simply executed calc.exe."
If the claims made by Hanson is true and his reported vulnerability is the same being used in the wild to spread Dridex, Microsoft left its customers vulnerable to the attacks even after being known of the critical flaw for quite long.


Enable 'Protected View' in Microsoft Office to Prevent Attack

Since the attack does not work when a malicious document is viewed in Office Protected View, users are advised to enable this feature in order to view any Office documents.

For more technical details about the latest Dridex malware campaign exploiting the unpatched Microsoft Word flaw, you can head on to the blog post published by Proofpoint.

Google's Chrome web browser Extensions are under attack with a series of developers being hacked within last one month.

Almost two weeks ago, we reported how unknown attackers managed to compromise the Chrome Web Store account of a developer team and hijacked Copyfish extension, and then modified it to distribute spam correspondence to users.

Just two days after that incident, some unknown attackers then hijacked another popular extension 'Web Developer' and then updated it to directly inject advertisements into the web browser of over its 1 million users.

After Chris Pederick, the creator of 'Web Developer' Chrome extension that offers various web development tools to its users, reported to<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint </span>that his extension had been compromised, the security vendor analysed the issue and found further add-ons in the Chrome Store that had also been altered.

According to the latest report published by the researchers at Proofpoint on Monday, the expanded list of compromised Chrome Extensions are as below:


Chrometana (1.1.3)
Infinity New Tab (3.12.3)
CopyFish (2.8.5)
Web Paint (1.2.1)
Social Fixer (20.1.1)


Proofpoint researcher Kafeine also believes Chrome extensions TouchVPN and Betternet VPN were also compromised in the same way at the end of June.

In all the above cases, some unknown attackers first gained access to the developers' Google web accounts by sending out phishing emails with malicious links to steal account credentials.

Once the attackers gained access to the accounts, either they hijacked their respective extensions and then modified them to perform malicious tasks, or they add malicious Javascript code to them in an attempt to hijack traffic and expose users to fake ads and password theft in order to generate revenue.

In the case of the Copyfish extension, the attackers even moved the whole extension to one of its developers' accounts, preventing the software company from removing the infected extension from the Chrome store, even after being spotted compromised behaviour of the extension.

"Threat actors continue to look for new ways to drive traffic to affiliate programs and effectively surface malicious advertisements to users," researchers concluded. "In the cases described here, they are leveraging compromised Chrome extensions to hijack traffic and substitute advertisements on victims' browsers."¬†

"Once they obtain developer credentials through emailed phishing campaigns, they can publish malicious versions of legitimate extensions."
At this time, it is unclear who is behind the hijackings of Chrome Web extensions.

The best way to protect yourself from such attacks is always to be suspicious of uninvited documents sent over a phishing email and never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source.

A massive malicious email campaign that stems from the Necurs botnet is spreading a new ransomware at the rate of 5 million emails per hour and hitting computers across the globe.

Dubbed "Jaff," the new file-encrypting ransomware is very similar to the infamous Locky ransomware in many ways, but it is demanding 1.79 Bitcoins (approx $3,150), which much higher than Locky, to unlock the encrypted files on an infected computer.

According to security researchers at Forcepoint Security Lab, Jaff ransomware, written in C programming language, is being distributed with the help of Necurs botnet that currently controls over 6 million infected computers worldwide.

Necurs botnet is sending emails to millions of users with an attached PDF document, which if clicked, opens up an embedded Word document with a malicious macro script to downloads and execute the Jaff ransomware, Malwarebytes says.


Jaff is Spreading at the Rate of 5 Million per Hour


The malicious email campaign started on Thursday morning at 9 am and had peaked by 1 pm, and its system recorded and blocked more than 13 million emails during that period ‚Äì that's 5 Million emails per an hour.

"Jaff targets 423 file extensions. It is capable of offline encryption without dependency on a command and control server. Once a file is encrypted, the '.jaff' file extension is appended," Forcepoint says.
The ransomware then drops a ransom note in every affected folder while the desktop background of the infected computer is also replaced.

The ransom note tells victims that their files are encrypted, but doesn‚Äôt ask them for any payments; instead, it urges victims to visit a payment portal located on a Tor site, which is accessible via Tor Browser, in order to get decrypt their important files.

Once victims install Tor Browser and visit the secret site, there they are then asked for an astounding 1.79 BTC (about $3,150).


Separate research conducted by<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint </span>researchers indicated that the Jaff ransomware could be the work of the same cybercriminal gang behind Locky, Dridex, and Bart.

The security company said that the Raff ransomware campaign had affected users globally with primarily victim organizations in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Mexico and Australia.


Massive Ransomware Attack Uses NSA's Windows Exploit

In separate news, another massive fast-spreading ransomware campaign is targeting computers at Hospitals, Banks, Telecom and Organisations across the globe today.

The ransomware, known as WanaCypt0r or WannaCry, is using NSA's Windows exploit, EternalBlue, which was leaked by Shadow Brokers hacking group over a month ago.

Within just hours this cyber attack has infected more than 60,000 computers in 74 countries.


How can you Protect yourself from the Jaff Ransomware?

To safeguard against such ransomware infection, you should always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent an email and should never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source.

Check if macros are disabled in your Microsoft Office applications. If not, block macros from running in Office files from the Internet. In enterprises, your system admin can set the default setting for macros.

To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC.

Moreover, make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your system, and most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

Researchers from cybersecurity firm<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint </span>have recently discovered a large-scale malvertising campaign that exposed millions of Internet users in the United States, Canada, the UK, and Australia to malware infections.

Active for more than a year and still ongoing, the malware campaign is being conducted by a hacking group called KovCoreG, which is well known for distributing Kovter ad fraud malware that was used in 2015 malicious ad campaigns, and most recently earlier in 2017.

The KovCoreG hacking group initially took advantage of P0rnHub‚Äîone of the world's most visited adult websites‚Äîto distribute fake browser updates that worked on all three major Windows web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge/Internet Explorer.

According to the Proofpoint researchers, the infections in this campaign first appeared on P0rnHub web pages via a legitimate advertising network called Traffic Junky, which tricked users into installing the Kovtar malware onto their systems.

Among other malicious things, the Kovter malware is known for its unique persistence mechanism, allowing the malware to load itself after every reboot of the infected host.

The Traffic Junky advertising network redirected users to a malicious website, where Chrome and Firefox users were shown a fake browser update window, while Internet Explorer and Edge users got a fake Flash update.


"The [infection] chain begins with a malicious redirect hosted on avertizingms[.]com, which inserts a call hosted behind KeyCDN, a major content delivery network," Proofpoint writes.

The attackers used a number of filters and fingerprinting of "the timezone, screen dimension, language (user/browser) history length of the current browser windows, and unique id creation via Mumour," in an effort to target users and evade analysis.

Researchers said Chrome users were infected with a JavaScript which beaconed back to the server controlled by the attackers, preventing security analysts working through the infection chain if their IP had not "checked in."

"This makes it extremely unlikely that the JavaScript can be run alone and provide the payload in a sandbox environment," Proofpoint writes. "This is most likely why this component of the chain has not been documented previously."

In this case, the attackers limited their campaign to click fraud to generate illicit revenue, but Proofpoint researchers believed the malware could easily be modified to spread ransomware, information stealing Trojans or any other malware.

Both P0rnHub and Traffic Junky, according to the researchers, "acted swiftly to remediate this threat upon notification."

Although this particular infection chain was successfully shut down after the site operator and ad network got notified, the malware campaign is still ongoing elsewhere.

In BriefYou should not miss this month‚Äôs Patch Updates, as it brings fixes for critical issues in Adobe Flash Player, iOS, Xcode, the Apple Watch, Windows, Internet Explorer, and the Edge browser.

Adobe has rolled out a critical update to address several issues, most of which are Remote Code Execution flaws, in its widely-used Adobe Flash Player for Windows, Macintosh, Linux and ChromeOS. Whereas, Microsoft has released 14 security updates to fix a total of 50 vulnerabilities in Windows and related software.
First of all, if you have Adobe Flash Player installed and have not yet updated your software plugin, you are playing with fire.

Critical Flash Vulnerabilities Affect Windows, Mac, Linux and ChromeOS
Adobe has released its latest round of security patches to address critical vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and ChromeOS.

The Flash vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the vulnerable system. So, users are strongly advised to update to Flash Player version 23.0.0.162 before hackers have their hands on it.

However, the best advice I can give you is to ditch this insecure, buggy software once and for all and significantly improve the security of your system in the process.

Even PornHub said Good Bye to Flash Player, so it's no longer an excuse for you to keep Flash on your PC ;)

Meanwhile, Microsoft has released its September 2016 Patch Update that includes 14 bulletins, seven of which earned its most dire "critical" rating and seven are rated as "important," addressing a total of 50 vulnerabilities.

Critical Zero-Day Exploit in the Wild
The most critical vulnerability addressed by Microsoft in the MS16-104 and MS16-105 update is a zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer (IE) and Edge.

Dubbed Microsoft Browser Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2016-3351), the zero-day flaw could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution attacks by tricking a victim to view a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer or Edge.

If exploited successfully, the attacker would gain the same user rights as the current user and could take control of an affected system, if the victim is logged on with administrative user rights, potentially allowing the attacker to install malware, modify or delete data, or even create new accounts with full user rights.

This informational disclosure bug was first reported by<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint </span>researchers with the help of Trend Micro in 2015, when they uncovered a massive malvertising campaign, dubbed AdGholas, actively exploiting the CVE-2016-3351 flaw.

The researchers also found another hacking group named GooNky actively exploiting the flaw. For in-depth details about the flaw, you can head on to Proofpoint's blog post.

Another critical bulletin MS16-108 affecting organizations using Exchange Server for their email platform addresses a file format parsing flaw that could be exploited by attackers using remote-code execution to get full control of the Exchange Server. This flaw affects all supported versions of Exchange Server.

To exploit the flaw, all an attacker needs is to send a malicious file to anyone in the organization and Boom! Exchange Server pre-parses to find out the file type, which would get the malicious exploit triggered before users even get the file.

Other Critical and Important flaws in Windows and its Software
Other critical Bulletins include MS16-106 that fixes five holes in the Windows Graphics Device Interface; MS16-107 that contains patches for Microsoft Office and SharePoint to address a total of 13 vulnerabilities; MS16-116 that fixes a RCE flaw in Microsoft OLE Automation mechanism and the VBScript Scripting Engine; and MS16-117 that includes critical fixes for Adobe Flash libraries contained in Internet Explorer 10 and 11 and Microsoft Edge.

Note: The MS16-11 fix requires users to first apply the Internet Explorer update (MS16-104) in order to be effective.

Important Bulletins include fixes for RCE flaws in Windows, SMBv1 Server and Silverlight; elevation of privilege flaws in the Windows Kernel and Windows Lock Screen; an information disclosure bug in the Windows Secure Kernel Mode; and a pair of information disclosure vulnerabilities in Windows PDF Library.

Users are advised to apply Windows as well as Adobe patches to keep away hackers and cybercriminals from taking control over your computer.

Microsoft Ends Tuesday Patches Trend
The September Patch Update was the last traditional Windows Patch Tuesday as the tech giant is moving to a new patching release model.

The future patch updates will bundle all patches together, and you will no longer be able to select which updates to install. The whole package of patches will be installed altogether, which will leave no chance for hackers to target vulnerabilities for which patches are already released.

In addition, the new "Monthly Rollup" will be combined and delivered to the users. Like the November patch update will also include all the patches from October.

Recently we reported about a critical code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Word that was being exploited in the wild by cyber criminal groups to distribute malware like Dridex banking trojans and Latentbot.

Now, it turns out that the same previously undisclosed vulnerability in Word (CVE-2017-0199) was also actively being exploited by the government-sponsored hackers to spy on Russian targets since at least this January.

The news comes after security firm FireEye, that independently discovered this flaw last month, published a blog post, revealing that FinSpy spyware was installed as early as January using the same vulnerability in Word that was patched on Tuesday by Microsoft.

For those unaware, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) is a code execution flaw in Word that could allow an attacker to take over a fully patched and up to date computer when the victim opens a Word document containing a booby-trapped OLE2link object,¬†which downloads a malicious HTML app from a server, disguised as a document created in Microsoft's RTF (Rich Text Format).

FinSpy or FinFisher is associated with the controversial UK-based firm Gamma Group, which sells so-called "lawful intercept" spyware to governments around the world.

"Though only one Finspy user has been observed leveraging this zero-day exploit, the historical scope of Finspy, a capability used by several nation-states, suggests other customers had access to it," FireEye researchers said.¬†


"Additionally, this incident exposes the global nature of cyber threats and the value of worldwide perspective‚Äîa cyber espionage incident targeting Russians can provide an opportunity to learn about and interdict crime against English speakers elsewhere."
Months later in March, the same then-zero-day vulnerability was used to install Latentbot, a bot-like, information-stealing and remote-access malware package used by financially motivated criminals.

Latentbot has several malicious capabilities including credential theft, remote desktop functions, hard drive and data wiping, and the ability to disable antivirus software.

FireEye said criminals used social engineering to trick victims into opening the attachments with generic subject lines like "hire_form.doc", "!!!!URGENT!!!!READ!!!.doc", "PDP.doc", and "document.doc".
However, on Monday, the criminals behind the attack modified their campaign to deliver a different malware package called Terdot, which then installed software that uses the TOR anonymity service to hide the identity of the servers it contacted with.

According to FireEye researchers, the MS Word exploit used to install Finspy on Russian computers by government spies and the one used in March to install Latentbot by criminal hackers was obtained from the same source.

This finding highlights that someone who initially discovered this zero-day vulnerability sold it to many actors, including the commercial companies who deals in buying and selling of zero-day exploits as well as financially motivated online criminals.

Also, just Monday evening,<span class="highlight-match"> Proofpoint </span>researchers too discovered a massive campaign of spam email targeting millions of users across financial institutions in Australia with the Dridex banking malware, again, by exploiting the same vulnerability in Word.

FireEye researchers are still not sure of the source for the exploit that delivered the Dridex banking trojan, but it is possible that the vulnerability disclosure by McAfee last week provided insight that helped Dridex operators use the flaw, or that someone with access to the Word exploit gave it to them.

Microsoft patched the MS Word vulnerability on Tuesday, which hackers, as well as government spies, had been exploiting it for months. So, users are strongly advised to install updates as soon as possible to protect themselves against the ongoing attacks.

Yesterday WikiLeaks published thousands of documents revealing top CIA hacking secrets, including the agency's ability to break into iPhones, Android phones, smart TVs, and Microsoft, Mac and Linux operating systems.

It dubbed the first release as Vault 7.

Vault 7 is just the first part of leak series ‚ÄúYear Zero‚Äù that WikiLeaks will be releasing in coming days. Vault 7 is all about a covert global hacking operation being run by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

According to the whistleblower organization, the CIA did not inform the companies about the security issues of their products; instead held on to security bugs in software and devices, including iPhones, Android phones, and Samsung TVs, that millions of people around the world rely on.

One leaked document suggested that the CIA was even looking for tools to remotely control smart cars and trucks, allowing the agency to cause "accidents" which would effectively be "nearly undetectable assassinations."

While security experts, companies and non-profit organizations are still reviewing 8,761 documents released as Vault 7 archive, we are here with some relevant facts and points that you need to know.

Here's Everything You Need to Know About Vault 7:

WikiLeaks Exposes CIA's Mobile Hacking SecretsVault7 ‚Äî CIA has an impressive list of ways to hack into your iOS, Android & Windows phones.
CLICK TO TWEETVault 7 purportedly includes 8,761 documents and files that detail intelligence information on CIA-developed software intended to crack any Android smartphone or Apple iPhone, including some that could take full control of the devices.

In fact, Wikileaks alleges that the CIA has a sophisticated unit in its Mobile Development Branch that develops zero-day exploits and malware to "infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads."

Some of the attacks are powerful enough to allow an attacker to remotely take over the "kernel," the heart of the operating system that controls the smartphone operation, or to gain "root" access on the devices, giving the attacker access to information like geolocation, communications, contacts, and more.

These types of attacks would most likely be useful for targeted hacking, rather than mass surveillance.

The leaked documents also detail some specific attacks the agency can perform on certain smartphones models and operating systems, including recent versions of iOS and Android.

CIA Didn't Break Encryption Apps, Instead Bypassed ItVault7 ‚Äî CIA-made phone malware can read your private chats without breaking encryption.CLICK TO TWEETIn the hours since the documents were made available by WikiLeaks, a misconception was developed, making people believe the CIA "cracked" the encryption used by popular secure messaging software including Signal and WhatsApp.

WikiLeaks asserted that:
"These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloakman by hacking the "smart" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied."This statement by WikiLeaks made most people think that the encryption used by end-to-end encrypted messaging clients such as Signal and WhatsApp has been broken.

No, it hasn't.

Instead, the CIA has tools to gain access to entire phones, which would of course "bypass" encrypted messaging apps because it fails all other security systems virtually on the phone, granting total remote access to the agency.

The WikiLeaks documents do not show any attack particular against Signal or WhatsApp, but rather the agency hijacks the entire phone and listens in before the applications encrypt and transmit information.

It‚Äôs like you are sitting in a train next to the target and reading his 2-way text conversation on his phone or laptop while he's still typing, this doesn't mean that the security of the app the target is using has any issue.

In that case, it also doesn't matter if the messages were encrypted in transit if you are already watching everything that happens on the device before any security measure comes into play.

But this also doesn't mean that this makes the issue lighter, as noted by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, "This incorrectly implies CIA hacked these apps/encryption. But the docs show iOS/Android are what got hacked‚Äîa much bigger problem."

CIA Develops Malware to targets Windows, Linux & MacOSVault7 ‚Äî CIA also develops cross-platform malware to hack Windows, MacOS & Linux ComputersCLICK TO TWEETThe Wikileaks CIA dump also includes information about the malware that can be used by the agency to hack, remotely spy on and control PCs running Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

This apparently means that the CIA can bypass PGP email encryption and even Virtual Private Network (VPN) on your computer in a similar way. The agency can also see everything you are doing online, even if you are hiding it behind Tor Browser. 

Again, this also does not mean that using PGP, VPNs, or Tor Browser is not safe or that the CIA can hack into these services.

But the agency's ability to hack into any OS to gain full control of any device  ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a smartphone, a laptop, or a TV with a microphone ‚Äî makes the CIA capable of bypassing any service spy on everything that happens on that device.

CIA Borrowed Codes from Public Malware SamplesVault7 ‚Äî CIA uses codes from publicly available #malware samples to build its own spyware.CLICK TO TWEETYes, in addition to the attacks purportedly developed by the CIA, the agency has adopted some of the code from other, public sources of malware. Well, that's what many does.

One of the documents mentions how the agency supposedly tweaks bits of code from known malware samples to develop its custom code and more targeted solutions.

"The UMBRAGE team maintains a library of application development techniques borrowed from in-the-wild malware," the WikiLeaks document reads. "The goal of this repository is to provide functional code snippets that can be rapidly combined into custom solutions."
Some of the exploits listed were discovered and released by security firms, hacker groups, independent researchers, and purchased, or otherwise acquired by the CIA from other intelligence agencies, such as the FBI, NSA, and GCHQ.

One borrowed exploit in "Data Destruction Components" includes a reference to Shamoon, a nasty malware that has the capability to steal data and then completely wipe out hard-drives.

Another acquired attack by the CIA is SwampMonkey, which allows the agency to get root privileges on undisclosed Android devices.

Persistence, another tool in the CIA arsenal, allows the agency to gain control over the target device whenever it boots up again.

CIA Used Malware-Laced Apps to Spy on TargetsVault7 ‚Äî Fine Dining Attack: CIA used #malware-laced apps to spy on its targets.CLICK TO TWEETThe leaked documents include a file, named "Fine Dining," which does not contain any list of zero-day exploits or vulnerabilities, but a collection of malware-laced applications.

Fine Dining is a highly versatile technique which can be configured for a broad range of deployment scenarios, as it is meant for situations where the CIA agent has to infect a computer physically.

CIA field agents store one or more of these infected applications -- depending upon their targets -- on a USB, which they insert in their target's system to run one of the applications to gather the data from the device.

Developed by OSB (Operational Support Branch), a division of the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, Fine Dining includes modules that can be used to weaponize following applications:

The CIA's Desperation To Crack Apple's EncryptionVault7 ‚Äî CIA has desperately been working for years to break Apple's Encryption.CLICK TO TWEETThis is not the first time when the CIA has been caught targeting iOS devices. It was previously disclosed that the CIA was targeting Apple's iPhones and iPads, following the revelation of top-secret documents from the agency's internal wiki system in 2015 from the Snowden leaks.

The documents described that the CIA had been "targeting essential security keys used to encrypt data stored on Apple's devices" by using both "physical" and "non-invasive" techniques.

In addition to the CIA, the FBI hacking division Remote Operations Unit has also been working desperately to discover exploits in iPhones, one of the WikiLeaks documents indicates.

That could also be the reason behind the agency's effort to force Apple into developing a working exploit to hack into the iPhone belonging to one of the terrorists in the San Bernardino case.

Apple Says It Has Already Patched Most Flaws Documented in CIA LeakVault7 ‚Äî Apple says it has already patched many iOS vulnerabilities revealed in CIA Leaks.CLICK TO TWEETBesides vulnerabilities in Android and Samsung Smart TVs, the leaked documents detail 14 iOS exploits, describing how the agency uses these security issues to track users, monitor their communications, and even take complete control of their phones.

However, Apple is pushing back against claims that the CIA's stored bugs for its devices were effective.

According to Apple, many iOS exploits in the Wikileaks CIA document dump have already been patched in its latest iOS version, released in January, while Apple engineers continue to work to address any new vulnerabilities that were known to the CIA.

Here's the statement provided by an Apple spokesperson:
"Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers‚Äô privacy and security. The technology built into today‚Äôs iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we‚Äôre constantly working to keep it that way. Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80 percent of users running the latest version of our operating system. While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates."Hacking 'Anyone, Anywhere,' Thanks to Internet Of 'Insecure' ThingsVault7 ‚Äî CIA can hack your Smart TV and other smart devices to spy on you.CLICK TO TWEETBesides hundreds of exploits, zero-days, and hacking tools that targets a large number of software and services, Vault 7 also includes details about a surveillance technique ‚Äî codenamed Weeping Angel ‚Äî used by the CIA to infiltrate smart TVs.

Samsung smart TVs are found to be vulnerable to Weeping Angel hacks that place the TVs into a "Fake-Off" mode, in which the owner believes the TV is off when it is actually on, allowing the CIA to covertly record conversations "in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server."

"Weeping Angel already hooks key presses from the remote (or TV goes to sleep) to cause the system to enter Fake-Off rather than Off," the leaked CIA document reads. "Since the implant is already hooking these events, the implant knows when the TV will be entering Fake-Off mode."

In response to the WikiLeaks CIA documents, Samsung released a statement that reads: "Protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung. We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter."

WikiLeaks' CIA Leak Isn't Bigger than Snowden's NSA LeaksThe CIA isn't more advanced than the NSA TAO Team and Vault 7 leak isn‚Äôt even bigger than Snowden .CLICK TO TWEETWikiLeaks claims the massive CIA hacking leak is larger than the Edward Snowden revelations about NSA's hacking and surveillance programs, but it is much much smaller.

While the Snowden revelations disclosed the global covert surveillance through text, the voice of people using hacking tools that permitted mass data gathering and analysis, the CIA data dump so far just shows that the CIA gathered and purchased tools that could be used to target individual devices.

However, there is no evidence of mass surveillance of smartphones or computers in the leaked documents. Technologically, the NSA is much more forward in sophistication and technical expertise than the CIA.
Ex-CIA Chief Says Wikileaks dump has made US 'less safe'Vault7 ‚Äî Ex-CIA Chief says CIA files leaked by Wikileaks is incredibly damaging and has put lives at risk.CLICK TO TWEETFormer CIA boss Michael Hayden said the latest leak of highly sensitive CIA documents and files by Wikileaks is "incredibly damaging" and has put lives at risk, BBC reports, while the CIA has not yet commented on the leaks.

The CIA revelations by the whistleblower organization are just beginning. People will see more revelations about the government and agencies from the WikiLeaks in coming days as part of its Year Zero leaks.

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:


Avast (CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)
Avira (CVE-2017-6417)
Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)
Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)
Comodo
ESET
F-Secure
Kaspersky
Malwarebytes<span class="highlight-match">
McAfee
</span>Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

It is no secret that cybercriminals are becoming dramatically more adept, innovative, and stealthy with each passing day.

While new forms of cybercrime are on the rise, traditional activities seem to be shifting towards more clandestine techniques that involve the exploitation of standard system tools and protocols, which are not always monitored.

The latest example of such attack is DNSMessenger ‚Äì a new Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that uses DNS queries to conduct malicious PowerShell commands on compromised computers ‚Äì a technique that makes the RAT difficult to detect onto targeted systems.

The Trojan came to the attention of Cisco's Talos threat research group by a security researcher named Simpo, who highlighted a tweet that encoded text in a PowerShell script that said 'SourceFireSux.' SourceFire is one of Cisco's corporate security products.


DNSMessenger Attack Is Completely Fileless

Further analysis of the malware ultimately led Talos researchers to discover a sophisticated attack comprising a malicious Word document and a PowerShell backdoor communicating with its command-and-control servers via DNS requests.

Distributed through an email phishing campaign, the DNSMessenger attack is completely Fileless, as it does not involve writing files to the targeted system; instead, it uses DNS TXT messaging capabilities to fetch malicious PowerShell commands stored remotely as DNS TXT records.

This feature makes it invisible to standard anti-malware defenses.

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language built into Windows that allows for the automation of system administration tasks.


The malicious Word document has been crafted "to appear as if it were associated with a secure e-mail service that is secured by<span class="highlight-match"> McAfee,</span>" according to a blog post published by Talos researchers Edmund Brumaghin and Colin Grady on Thursday.


Here's How the DNSMessenger attack Works:

When opened, the document launches a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro to execute a self-contained PowerShell script in an attempt to run the backdoor onto the target system.

What's interesting? Everything, until this point, is done in memory, without writing any malicious files to the system's disk.

Next, the VBA script unpacks a compressed and sophisticated second stage of PowerShell, which involves checking for several parameters of the target environment, like the privileges of the logged-in user and the version of PowerShell installed on the target system.

This information is then used to ensure persistence on the infected host by changing the Windows Registry and installing a third stage PowerShell script that contains a simple backdoor.

The backdoor is being added to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) database, if the victim does have administrative access, allowing the malware backdoor to stay persistent on the system even after a reboot.

The backdoor is an additional script that establishes a sophisticated 2-way communications channel over the Domain Name System (DNS) ‚Äì usually used to look up the IP addresses associated with domain names, but has support for different types of records.

The DNSMessenger malware backdoor uses DNS TXT records that, by definition, allows a DNS server to attach unformatted text to a response.

The backdoor periodically sends DNS queries to one of a series of domains hard-coded in its source code. As part of those requests, it retrieves the domain's DNS TXT record, which contains further PowerShell commands that are executed but never written to the local system.

Now, this "fourth stage" Powershell script is the actual remote control tool used by the malware attacker.

This script queries the command-and-control servers via DNS TXT message requests to ask what commands to execute. Any command received is then executed, and the output is communicated back to the C&C server, allowing the attacker to execute any Windows or application commands on the infected system.

All attackers need to do is leave malicious commands and instructions inside the TXT records of their domains, which, when queried, is executed via the Windows Command Line Processor, and the output is sent back as another DNS query.

The domains registered by the DNSMessenger RAT are all down, so till now, it is not known that what types of commands the attackers relayed to infected systems. However, the researchers say this particular RAT was used in a small number of targeted attacks.

"This malware sample is an excellent example of the length attackers are willing to go to stay undetected while operating within the environments that they are targeting," the Talos researchers said.

"It also illustrates the importance that in addition to inspecting and filtering network protocols such as HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP/POP3, etc. DNS traffic within corporate networks should also be considered a channel that an attacker can use to implement a fully functional, bidirectional C2 infrastructure."
This is not the first time when the researchers came across a Fileless malware. At early last month, Kaspersky researchers also discovered fileless malware, that resides solely in the memory of the compromised computers, targeting banks, telecommunication companies, and government organizations in 40 countries.

If you are a regular reader of The Hacker News, you might be aware of an ongoing cyber attack ‚Äî detected in the wild by<span class="highlight-match"> McAfee </span>and FireEye ‚Äî that silently installs malware on fully-patched computers by exploiting an unpatched Microsoft Word vulnerability in all current versions of Microsoft Office.

Now, according to security firm Proofpoint, the operators of the Dridex malware started exploiting the unpatched Microsoft Word vulnerability to spread a version of their infamous Dridex banking trojan.

Dridex is currently one of the most dangerous banking trojans on the Internet that exhibits the typical behavior of monitoring a victim's traffic to bank sites by infiltrating PCs and stealing victim's online banking credentials and financial data.

The Dridex actors usually relied on macro-laden Word files to distribute the malware through spam messages or emails.

However, this is the first time when researchers found the Dridex operators using an unpatched zero-day flaw in Microsoft Word for distributing their banking trojan.



According to a blog post published Monday night by Proofpoint, the latest Dridex spam campaign is delivering Word documents weaponized with this zero-day to millions of recipients across several organizations, including banks primarily located in Australia.

"Emails in this campaign used an attached Microsoft Word RTF (Rich Text Format) document. Messages purported to be from "[device]@[recipient's domain]." [Device] may be "copier", "documents", "noreply", "no-reply", or "scanner"," Proofpoint researchers say.¬†


"The subject line in all cases read "Scan Data" and included attachments named "Scan_123456.doc" or "Scan_123456.pdf", where "123456" was replaced with random digits...the spoofed email domains and the common practice of emailing digitized versions of documents make the lures fairly convincing."
As we reported on Saturday, this zero-day flaw is severe because it gives hackers power to bypass most exploit mitigations developed by Microsoft, and unlike past Word exploits seen in the wild, it doesn't require victims to enable Macros.

Moreover, given the danger of Dridex ‚Äì also known as Bugat and Cridex ‚Äì banking trojan, people are strongly advised not to open Word documents attached to an email from anyone, even if you know the sender until Microsoft releases a patch.


Microsoft knew of the flaw very long ago

According to researchers at McAfee and FireEye, Microsoft has known of the remote code flaw since January and could release a patch for the vulnerability today, as part of its regular Patch Tuesday routine.

However, an independent security researcher Ryan Hanson claimed that he discovered this 0-day, along with the two other flaws, in July and reported it to Microsoft in October 2016.

"The initial discovery was in July, which was followed up by additional research and the identification of a protected view bypass vulnerability. Those two bugs and an additional Outlook bug were submitted to MS in October," Hanson told The Hacker News.¬†

"There may very well be additional HTA related vectors in Office, but based on the detail provided by McAfee, the vulnerability they've identified functions exactly like the one I disclosed. The only difference I see is the VBScript payload, since my payload simply executed calc.exe."
If the claims made by Hanson is true and his reported vulnerability is the same being used in the wild to spread Dridex, Microsoft left its customers vulnerable to the attacks even after being known of the critical flaw for quite long.


Enable 'Protected View' in Microsoft Office to Prevent Attack

Since the attack does not work when a malicious document is viewed in Office Protected View, users are advised to enable this feature in order to view any Office documents.

Many people believe that they are much less likely to be bothered by malware if they use a Mac computer, but is it really true? Unfortunately, No.

According to the<span class="highlight-match"> McAfee </span>Labs, malware attacks on Apple's Mac computers were up 744% in 2016, and its researchers have discovered nearly 460,000 Mac malware samples, which is still just a small part of overall Mac malware out in the wild.

Today, Malware Research team at CheckPoint have discovered a new piece of fully-undetectable Mac malware, which according to them, affects all versions of Mac OS X, has zero detections on VirusTotal and is "signed with a valid developer certificate (authenticated by Apple)."

Dubbed DOK, the malware is being distributed via a coordinated email phishing campaign and, according to the researchers, is the first major scale malware to target macOS users.

The malware has been designed to gain administrative privileges and install a new root certificate on the target system, which allows attackers to intercept and gain complete access to all victim communication, including SSL encrypted traffic.

Just almost three months ago, Malwarebytes researchers also discovered a rare piece of Mac-based espionage malware, dubbed Fruitfly, that was used to spy on biomedical research center computers and remained undetected for years.


Here's How the DOK Malware Works:


The malware is distributed via a phishing email masquerading as a message regarding supposed inconsistencies in their tax returns, tricking the victims into running an attached malicious .zip file, which contains the malware.

Since the malware author is using a valid developer certificate signed by Apple, the malware easily bypasses Gatekeeper -- an inbuilt security feature of the macOS operating system by Apple. Interestingly, the DOK malware is also undetectable in almost all antivirus products.

Once installed, the malware copies itself to the /Users/Shared/ folder and then add to "loginItem" in order to make itself persistent, allowing it to execute automatically every time the system reboots, until it finishes to install its payload.

The malware then creates a window on top of all other windows, displaying a message claiming that a security issue has been identified in the operating system and an update is available, for which the user has to enter his/her password.

Once the victim installed the update, the malware gains administrator privileges on the victim's machine and changes the victim system's network settings, allowing all outgoing connections to pass through a proxy.

According to¬†CheckPoint researchers,¬†"using those privileges, the malware will then install brew, a package manager for OS X, which will be used to install additional tools ‚Äì TOR and SOCAT."


DOK Deletes itself after Setting up Attacker's Proxy


The malware then installs a new root certificate in the infected Mac, which allows the attacker to intercept the victim‚Äôs traffic using a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack.

"As a result of all of the above actions, when attempting to surf the web, the user‚Äôs web browser will first ask the attacker web page on TOR for proxy settings," the researchers say.

"The user traffic is then redirected through a proxy controlled by the attacker, who carries out a Man-In-the-Middle attack and impersonates the various sites the user attempts to surf. The attacker is free to read the victim's traffic and tamper with it in any way they please."
According to researchers, almost no antivirus has updated its signature database to detect the DOK OS X malware, as the malware deletes itself once it modifies proxy settings on the target machines for interceptions.

Apple can resolve this issue just by revoking the developer certificate being abused by the malware author.

Meanwhile, users are always recommended to avoid clicking links contained in messages or emails from untrusted sources and always pay extra attention before proving your root password.


Update:¬†Apple Revokes Certificate Used By Dok Mac Malware


After this story had gone up, Apple responded to the issue and revoked the legitimate developer certificate used by hackers behind the DOK malware that can be used to eavesdrop on victim's communication, including secure HTTPS traffic.


MalwareBytes has confirmed this in its blog post, which reads: "Apple has already revoked the certificate used to sign the app, so, at this point, anyone who encounters this malware will be unable to open the app and unable to be infected by it."

It further adds: "If the user clicks past this warning to open the app, it will display a warning that the file could not be opened, which is simply a cover for the fact that no document opened, as shown above."

Besides this, Apple also rolled out an update this weekend to its XProtect built-in anti-malware software in an attempt to prevent existing and future DOK-type malware attacks.

While some payment card companies like Mastercard have switched to selfies as an alternative to passwords when verifying IDs for online payments, hackers have already started taking advantage of this new security verification methods.

Researchers have discovered a new Android banking Trojan that masquerades primarily as a video plugin, like Adobe Flash Player, pornographic app, or video codec, and asks victims to send a selfie holding their ID card, according to a blog post published by<span class="highlight-match"> McAfee.</span>

The Trojan is the most recent version of Acecard that has been labeled as one of the most dangerous Android banking Trojans known today, according to Kaspersky Lab Anti-malware Research Team.

Once successfully installed, the trojan asks users for a number of device's permissions to execute the malicious code and then waits for victims to open apps, specifically those where it would make sense to request payment card information. 


Acecard Steals your Payment Card and Real ID details


The banking trojan then overlays itself on top of the legitimate app where it proceeds to ask users for their payment card number and card details such as card holder's name, expiration date, and CVV number.

"It displays its own window over the legitimate app, asking for your credit card details," explains McAfee researcher Bruce Snell. "After validating the card number, it goes on to ask for additional information such as the 4-digit number on the back."
Once this is done, the trojan then looks to obtain users' personal information, including their name, date of birth, mailing address, for "verification purposes," and even requests a photo of the front and back sides of their ID card.

After this, the Trojan also prompts to ask users to hold their ID card in their hand, underneath their face, and take a selfie. 


Hackers can make illegal Transfers and Take Over your Online Accounts

All these pieces of information are more than enough for an attacker to verify illegal banking transactions and steal access to victims' social media accounts by confirming the stolen identities.

So far this version of Acecard Android banking Trojan has impacted users in Singapore and Hong Kong.

This social engineering trick of Trojan obviously is not new, and any tech-savvy users would quickly catch this malicious behavior as there is no reason for Google to ask for your ID card. But the trick still works with non and less technical users.

Since all of these fake apps have been distributed outside of Google Play Store, users are strongly advised to avoid downloading and installing apps from untrusted sources. Besides this, users should pay attention to the permissions apps are asking for.

Most importantly: No app needs a photo of you holding your ID card except perhaps a mobile banking service. So, always be cautious before doing that.

The Shadow Brokers who previously stole and leaked a portion of the NSA hacking tools and exploits is back with a Bang!

The hacking group is now selling another package of hacking tools, ‚ÄúEquation Group Windows Warez,‚Äù which includes Windows exploits and antivirus bypass tools, stolen from the NSA-linked hacking unit, The Equation Group.

For those unfamiliar with the topic, The Shadow Brokers is a notorious group of black-hat hackers who, in August 2016, leaked exploits, security vulnerabilities, and "powerful espionage tools" created by The Equation Group.

On Saturday, the Shadow Brokers posted a message on their ZeroNet based website, announcing the sale of the entire "Windows Warez" collection for 750 Bitcoin (around US$678,630).

The data dump contains many windows hacking tools, categorized as following:

Fuzzing tools (used to discover errors and security loopholes)
Exploit Framework
Network Implants
Remote Administration Tools (RAT)
Remote Code Execution Exploits for IIS, RDP, RPC, SMB Protocols (Some Zero-Days)
SMB BackDoor (Implant)

Interestingly, the Remote Administration Tool (RAT) "DanderSpritz" included in the list is the one previously leaked in the NSA's documents revealed by Edward Snowden.

Besides this, malware researcher Jacob Williams analyzed the archive of "screenshots and output of the find command across the dump" provided by the hacker as an evidence of legitimacy and estimated that the tools may also include a Fully Undetectable Malware (FUD) toolkit.


The FUD toolkit might have an ability to "evade/bypass personal security products," such as Avira, Avast, Dr.Web, ESET Antivirus, Comodo,<span class="highlight-match"> McAfee </span>Antivirus, Microsoft Essential, Panda, Symantec, Trend Micro and Kaspersky Antivirus.

The buyers can purchase the entire database of hacking tools that The Equation Group used against various countries to expand its espionage operations.

In August, the Shadow Brokers announced an auction attempting to sell the complete set of tools to the highest bidder, but the group canceled their auction in October due to little or no response on their public sale.

But since this time the group has made Windows hacking tools up for sale, the chances are that hackers and espionage groups would be interested in buying these hacking tools.

It's 2017, and opening a simple MS Word file could compromise your system.

Security researchers are warning of a new in-the-wild attack that silently installs malware on fully-patched computers by exploiting a serious ‚Äî and yet unpatched ‚Äî zero-day vulnerability in all current versions of Microsoft Office.

The Microsoft Office zero-day attack, uncovered by researchers from security firms<span class="highlight-match"> McAfee </span>and FireEye, starts simply with an email that attaches a malicious Word file containing a booby-trapped OLE2link object.

When opened, the exploit code gets executed and makes a connection to a remote server controlled by the attacker, from where it downloads a malicious HTML application file (HTA) that's disguised as a document created in Microsoft's RTF (Rich Text Format).

The HTA file then gets executed automatically with attackers gaining full code execution on the victim‚Äôs machine, downloading additional payloads from "different well-known malware families" to take over the victim's PC, and closing the weaponized Word file.


Zero-Day Attack Works on All Windows OS ‚Äî Even Windows 10

According to researchers, this zero-day attack is severe as it gives the attackers the power to bypass most exploit mitigations developed by Microsoft, and unlike past Word exploits seen in the wild, it does not require victims to enable Macros.

Due to these capabilities, this newly discovered attack works on all Windows operating systems even against Windows 10, which is believed to be Microsoft's most secure operating system to date.

Besides this, the exploit displays a decoy Word document for the victims to see before terminating in order to hide any sign of the attack.

"The successful exploit closes the bait Word document and pops up a fake one to show the victim," McAfee researchers wrote in a blog post published Friday. "In the background, the malware has already been stealthily installed on the victim's system."

"The root cause of the zero-day vulnerability is related to the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), an important feature of Office."
Microsoft is aware of the zero-day flaw as the researchers say they responsibly disclosed the issue to the company after detecting active attacks leveraging this unpatched flaw back in January this year.

FireEye disclosed the details of the vulnerability a day after McAfee went public with the flaw.

The next scheduled Microsoft's release of security updates is this Tuesday, so it's highly unlikely the company will be able to deliver a patch before that day.


How to Protect Yourself against this Attack?

Since the attack works on fully patched systems, users are highly advised to follow the below recommendations to mitigate such attacks:


Do not open or download any suspicious Word files that arrive in an e-mail, even if you know the sender until Microsoft releases a patch.
Since the attack does not work when a malicious document is viewed in Office Protected View feature, users are advised to enable this feature to view any Office documents.
Always keep your system and antivirus up-to-date.
Regularly backup your files in an external hard-drive.
Disabling Macros does not offer any protection, but yet users are advised to do so in an attempt to protect themselves against other attacks.
Always beware of phishing emails, spams, and clicking the malicious attachment.

Recently we reported about a critical code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Word that was being exploited in the wild by cyber criminal groups to distribute malware like Dridex banking trojans and Latentbot.

Now, it turns out that the same previously undisclosed vulnerability in Word (CVE-2017-0199) was also actively being exploited by the government-sponsored hackers to spy on Russian targets since at least this January.

The news comes after security firm FireEye, that independently discovered this flaw last month, published a blog post, revealing that FinSpy spyware was installed as early as January using the same vulnerability in Word that was patched on Tuesday by Microsoft.

For those unaware, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) is a code execution flaw in Word that could allow an attacker to take over a fully patched and up to date computer when the victim opens a Word document containing a booby-trapped OLE2link object,¬†which downloads a malicious HTML app from a server, disguised as a document created in Microsoft's RTF (Rich Text Format).

FinSpy or FinFisher is associated with the controversial UK-based firm Gamma Group, which sells so-called "lawful intercept" spyware to governments around the world.

"Though only one Finspy user has been observed leveraging this zero-day exploit, the historical scope of Finspy, a capability used by several nation-states, suggests other customers had access to it," FireEye researchers said.¬†


"Additionally, this incident exposes the global nature of cyber threats and the value of worldwide perspective‚Äîa cyber espionage incident targeting Russians can provide an opportunity to learn about and interdict crime against English speakers elsewhere."
Months later in March, the same then-zero-day vulnerability was used to install Latentbot, a bot-like, information-stealing and remote-access malware package used by financially motivated criminals.

Latentbot has several malicious capabilities including credential theft, remote desktop functions, hard drive and data wiping, and the ability to disable antivirus software.

FireEye said criminals used social engineering to trick victims into opening the attachments with generic subject lines like "hire_form.doc", "!!!!URGENT!!!!READ!!!.doc", "PDP.doc", and "document.doc".
However, on Monday, the criminals behind the attack modified their campaign to deliver a different malware package called Terdot, which then installed software that uses the TOR anonymity service to hide the identity of the servers it contacted with.

According to FireEye researchers, the MS Word exploit used to install Finspy on Russian computers by government spies and the one used in March to install Latentbot by criminal hackers was obtained from the same source.

This finding highlights that someone who initially discovered this zero-day vulnerability sold it to many actors, including the commercial companies who deals in buying and selling of zero-day exploits as well as financially motivated online criminals.

Also, just Monday evening, Proofpoint researchers too discovered a massive campaign of spam email targeting millions of users across financial institutions in Australia with the Dridex banking malware, again, by exploiting the same vulnerability in Word.

FireEye researchers are still not sure of the source for the exploit that delivered the Dridex banking trojan, but it is possible that the vulnerability disclosure by<span class="highlight-match"> McAfee </span>last week provided insight that helped Dridex operators use the flaw, or that someone with access to the Word exploit gave it to them.

Microsoft patched the MS Word vulnerability on Tuesday, which hackers, as well as government spies, had been exploiting it for months. So, users are strongly advised to install updates as soon as possible to protect themselves against the ongoing attacks.

After WannaCry and Petya ransomware outbreaks, a scary (but rather creative) new strain of ransomware is spreading via bogus apps on the Google Play Store, this time targeting Android mobile users.

Dubbed LeakerLocker, the Android ransomware does not encrypt files on victim's device, unlike traditional ransomware, rather it secretly collects personal images, messages and browsing history and threatens to share it to their contacts if they don't pay $50 (¬£38).

Researchers at security firm<span class="highlight-match"> McAfee </span>spotted the LeakerLocker ransomware in at least two apps ‚Äî Booster & Cleaner Pro and Wallpapers Blur HD ‚Äî in the Google Play Store, both of which have thousands of downloads.

To evade detection of malicious functionality, the apps initially don‚Äôt contain any malicious payload and typical function like legitimate apps.

But once installed by users, the apps load malicious code from its command-and-control server, which instructs them to collect a vast number of sensitive data from the victim's phone ‚Äî thanks to its victims granting unnecessary permissions blindly during installation.

The LeakerLocker ransomware then locks the home screen and displays a message that contains details of the data it claims to have stolen and holds instructions on how to pay the ransom to ensure the information is deleted.

The ransom message reads:

All personal data from your smartphone has been transferred to our secure cloud.


In less than 72 hours this data will be sent to every person on your telephone and email contacts list. To abort this action you have to pay a modest ransom of $50 (¬£38).


Please note that there is no way to delete your data from our secure but paying for them. Powering off or even damaging your smartphone won't affect your data in the cloud.

Although the ransomware claims that it has taken a backup of all of your sensitive information, including personal photos, contact numbers, SMS', calls and GPS locations and browsing and correspondence history, researchers believe only a limited amount of data on victims is collected.

According to researchers, LeakerLocker can read a victim's email address, random contacts, Chrome history, some text messages and calls, take a picture from the camera, and read some device information.



All the above information is randomly chosen to display on the device screen, which is enough to convince the victims that lots of data have been copied.

Both malicious apps have since been removed by Google from the Play Store, but it is likely that hackers will try to smuggle their software into other apps.

If you have installed any of the two apps, uninstall it right now.

But if you are hit by the ransomware and are worried about your sexy selfies and photographs being leaked to your friends and relatives, you might be thinking of paying a ransom.

Do not pay the Ransom! Doing so motivates cyber criminals to carry out similar attacks, and there is also no guarantee that the stolen information will be deleted by the hackers from their server and will not be used to blackmail victims again.

Yahoo has patched a critical security vulnerability in its Mail service that could have allowed an attacker to spy on any Yahoo user's inbox.

Jouko Pynn√∂nen, a Finnish Security researcher from security firm Klikki Oy, reported a DOM based persistent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) in Yahoo mail, which if exploited, allows an attacker to send emails embedded with malicious code.

In his blog post published today, the researcher demonstrated how a malicious attacker could have sent the victim's inbox to an external site, and created a virus that attached itself to all outgoing emails by secretly adding a malicious script to message signatures.

Since the malicious code is in the message's body, the code will get executed as soon as the victim opens the boobytrapped email and its hidden payload script will covertly submit victim's inbox content to an external website controlled by the attacker.
This issue is because Yahoo Mail failed to properly filter potentially malicious code in HTML emails.

"It would be possible to embed a number of HTML attributes that are passed through Yahoo's HTML filter and treated specially," Pynn√∂nen says in his blog post.
Pynn√∂nen says he found the vulnerability by force-feeding all known HTML tags and attributes in order to the filter that Yahoo uses to weed out malicious HTML, but certain malicious HTML code managed to pass through.
"As a proof of concept I supplied Yahoo Security with an email that, when viewed, would use AJAX to read the user's inbox contents and send it to the attacker's server," Pynn√∂nen says.Pynn√∂nen privately disclosed the vulnerability to Yahoo through its<span class="highlight-match"> HackerOne </span>bug bounty program and was awarded a $10,000 bounty.

Pynn√∂nen reported a similar vulnerability in the web version of the Yahoo! Mail service earlier this year for which he earned $10,000. He also reported a stored XSS vulnerability in Flickr to Yahoo in December 2015 for which he earned $500.

With the growing number of data breaches and cyber attacks, a significant number of companies and organizations have started Bug Bounty programs for encouraging hackers and bug hunters to find and responsibly report vulnerabilities in their services and get rewarded.

Now, following the success of the "Hack the Pentagon" and "Hack the Army" initiatives, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) has announced the launch of the "Hack the Air Force" bug bounty program.

Hacking or breaking into Defense Department networks was illegal once, but after "Hack the Pentagon" initiative, the DoD started rewarding outsiders to finding and reporting weaknesses in its private networks.

"This is the first time the AF [Air Force] has opened up...networks to such a broad scrutiny," Peter Kim, the Air Force Chief Information Security Officer said in a statement. "We have malicious hackers trying to get into our systems every day."

"It'll be nice to have friendly hackers taking a shot and, most importantly, showing us how to improve our cyber security and defense posture. The additional participation from our partner nations greatly widens the variety of experience available to find additional unique vulnerabilities."
The "Hack the Air Force" program is directed by<span class="highlight-match"> HackerOne,</span> the bug bounty startup that was behind Hack the Pentagon, and Luta Security, the security consulting company driving the U.K. program.


Hackers From The Five Eyes Nations Are Invited

This program will be the DoD's largest bug bounty project as it invites experts and white hat hackers not only from the United States, but also from remaining Five Eyes countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

So, only Hackers and bug hunters from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance are eligible to participate in Hack the Air Force.

"This outside approach ‚Äì drawing on the talent and expertise of our citizens and partner nation citizens ‚Äì in identifying our security vulnerabilities will help bolster our cyber security," said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein.

"We already aggressively conduct exercises and 'red team' our public facing and critical websites. But this next step throws open the doors and brings additional talent onto our cyber team."


Only Vetted Hackers Can Participate

Only "Vetted Hackers" can participate in Hack the Air Force program, which means the candidates must pass a rigorous background test after registration and have a clean criminal record in order to participate in the program.

However, according to some critics, this process excludes many talented hackers and bug hunters, but this is one of the common conditions across all of the Pentagon's bug bounty programs.

Registration for "Hack the Air Force" will start on May 15 and interested participants should register through HackerOne. The contest will launch on May 30 and last until June 23.

The first DoD bug bounty program, "Hack the Pentagon," came in April 2016, in which over 14,000 participating hackers found 138 vulnerabilities in DoD systems and were awarded over $75,000 in bounties.

Just like Bug Bounty programs offered by several Frontliners in the technology industry, Hack the Air Force is also an exercise for the federal authorities to boost up their security measures and counter the cyber attacks.

With the growing number of cyber attacks and breaches, a significant number of companies and organisations have started Bug Bounty programs for encouraging hackers, bug hunters and researchers to find and responsibly report bugs in their services and get rewarded.

Following major companies and organisations, the non-profit group behind Tor Project ‚Äì the largest online anonymity network that allows people to hide their real identity online ‚Äì has finally launched a "Bug Bounty Program."

The Tor Project announced on Thursday that it joined hands with<span class="highlight-match"> HackerOne </span>to start a public bug bounty program to encourage hackers and security researchers to find and privately report vulnerabilities that could compromise the anonymity network.

HackerOne is a bug bounty startup that operates bug bounty programs for companies including Yahoo, Twitter, Slack, Dropbox, Uber, General Motors ‚Äì and even the United States Department of Defense for Hack the Pentagon initiative.

Bug bounty programs are cash rewards gave by companies or organisations to white hat hackers and researchers who hunt for serious security vulnerabilities in their website or products and then responsibly disclose them.

The Tor Project announced its intention to launch a public bug bounty program in late December 2015 during a talk by the Tor Project at Chaos Communication Congress (CCC) held in Hamburg, Germany. However, it launched the invite-only bounty program last year.

The highest payout for the flaws has been kept $4,000 ‚Äî bug hunters can earn between $2,000 and $4,000 for High severity vulnerabilities, between $500 and $2,000 for Medium severity vulnerabilities, and a minimum of $100 for Low severity bugs.

Moreover, less severe issues will be rewarded with a t-shirt, stickers and a mention in Tor's hall of fame.

"Tor users around the globe, including human rights defenders, activists, lawyers, and researchers, rely on the safety and security of our software to be anonymous online," Tor browser developer Georg Koppen said in a blog post. "Help us protect them and keep them safe from surveillance, tracking, and attacks."
The Tor Project is a non-profit organisation behind the Tor anonymizing network that allows any online user to browse the Internet without the fear of being tracked.

The Project first announced its plan to launch the bug bounty program weeks after it accused the FBI of paying the researchers of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) at least $1 Million to help them Unmask Tor users and reveal their IP addresses, though FBI denies the claims.

With the growing number of cyber attacks and data breaches, a number of tech companies and organisations have started Bug Bounty programs for encouraging hackers, bug hunters and researchers to find and responsibly report bugs in their services and get rewarded.

Samsung is the latest in the list of tech companies to launch a bug bounty program, announcing that the South Korean electronics giant will offer rewards of up to $200,000 to anyone who discovers vulnerabilities in its mobile devices and associated software.

Dubbed Mobile Security Rewards Program, the newly-launched bug bounty program will cover 38 Samsung mobile devices released from 2016 onwards which currently receive monthly or quarterly security updates from the company.

So, if you want to take part in the Samsung Mobile Security Rewards Program, you have these devices as your target‚Äîthe Galaxy S, Galaxy Note, Galaxy A, Galaxy J, and the Galaxy Tab series, as well as Samsung's flagship devices, the S8, S8+, and Note 8.

"We take security and privacy issues very seriously; and as an appreciation for helping Samsung Mobile improve the security of our products and minimizing risk to our end-consumers, we are offering a rewards program for eligible security vulnerability reports," the company explains on its bug bounty website.¬†

"We look forward to your continued interests and participations in our Samsung Mobile Security Rewards Program. Through this rewards program, we hope to build and maintain valuable relationships with researchers who coordinate disclosure of security issues with Samsung Mobile."
Not just mobile devices, the tech giant's Mobile Services suite is also part of its bug bounty program, which will also cover apps and services such as Bixby, Samsung Account, Samsung Pay, Samsung Pass, among others.

For the eligibility of a reward, researchers and bug hunters need to provide a valid proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that can compromise a Samsung handset without requiring any physical connection or third-party application.

The company will evaluate the reward depending on the severity level of the vulnerability (Critical, High, Moderate, and Low) and its impact on devices. The least reward is $200, which is for low-severity flaws, while the highest reward is $200,000, which is for critical bugs.

The Higher reward will be offered for bugs that lead to trusted execution environment (TEE) or Bootloader compromise. The level of severity will be determined by Samsung.

Samsung‚Äôs bounty of $200,000 is equal to the bounty reward offered under Apple's bug bounty program but is slightly lower than Microsoft's newly launched bounty program that offers $250,000 for Windows 10 security bugs.

Following the path of major tech companies, the non-profit group behind Tor Project recently joined hands with<span class="highlight-match"> HackerOne </span>to launch its own bug bounty program, with the highest payout for the flaws has been kept $4,000.

So, what you are waiting for? Hunt for bugs in Samsung products and submit your findings to the company via the Security Reporting page.

Here we are with our weekly roundup, briefing this week's top cyber security threats, incidents and challenges.

This week has been very short with big news from shutting down of two of the largest Dark Web marketplaces and theft of millions of dollars in the popular Ethereum cryptocurrency to the discovery of new Linux malware leveraging SambaCry exploit.

We are here with the outline of this week's stories, just in case you missed any of them. We recommend you read the entire thing (just click 'Read More' because there's some valuable advice in there as well).

Here's the list of this Week's Top Stories:


1. Feds Shuts Down AlphaBay and Hansa Dark Web Markets ‚Äî Dream Market Under Suspicion

On Thursday, Europol announced that the authorities had shut down two of the largest criminal Dark Web markets ‚Äî AlphaBay and Hansa ‚Äî in what's being called the largest-ever international operation against the dark web's black market conducted by the FBI, DEA and Dutch National Police.

Interestingly, the federal authorities shut down AlphaBay, but before taking down Hansa market, they took control of the Dark Web market and kept it running for at least a month in an effort to monitor the activities of its visitors, including a massive flood of Alphabay refugees.

After the shutdown of both AlphaBay and Hansa, Dream Market has emerged as the leading player, which has been in business since 2013, but it has now been speculated by many dark web users that Dream Market is also under police control.

For detailed information ‚Äî Read more.


2. New Ransomware Threatens to Send Your Internet History to All Your Friends

After WannaCry and Petya ransomware outbreaks, a new strain of ransomware has been making the rounds on the Google Play Store in bogus apps, which targets Android mobile phone users.

Dubbed LeakerLocker, instead of encrypting files on your device, this Android ransomware secretly collects personal images, messages and browsing history and then threatens to share them with your contacts if you don't pay $50 (¬£38).

For more detailed information on the LeakerLocker ransomware ‚Äî Read more.


3. New CIA Leaks ‚Äî Smartphone Hacking and Malware Development


WikiLeaks last week published the 16th batch of its ongoing Vault 7 leak, revealing the CIA's Highrise Project that allowed the spying agency to stealthy collect and forwards stolen data from compromised smartphones to its server through SMS messages.

This week, the whistleblowing organisation revealed about a CIA contractor ‚Äî Raytheon Blackbird Technologies ‚Äî who was responsible for analysing advanced malware and hacking techniques being used in the wild by cyber criminals.

For more detailed information on Highrise Project and its contractor Raytheon Blackbird Technologies ‚Äî Read More.


4. Three Back-to-Back Multi-Million Dollar Ethereum Heist in 20 Days

This week, an unknown hacker stole nearly $32 Million worth of Ethereum ‚Äì one of the most popular and increasingly valuable cryptocurrencies ‚Äì from wallet accounts linked to at least three companies by exploiting a critical vulnerability in Parity's Ethereum Wallet software.

This was the third Ethereum cryptocurrency heist that came out two days after an alleged hacker stole $7.4 Million worth of Ether from trading platform CoinDash and two weeks after someone hacked into South Korean cryptocurrency exchange and stole more than $1 Million in Ether and Bitcoins from user accounts.

For more detailed information about the Ethereum Heist ‚Äî Read More.


5. Critical Gnome Flaw Leaves Linux PCs Vulnerable

This week has been bad for Linux users as well. A security researcher discovered a code injection vulnerability in the thumbnail handler component of GNOME Files file manager that allowed hackers to execute malicious code on targeted Linux machines.

German researcher Nils Dagsson Moskopp dubbed the vulnerability Bad Taste (CVE-2017-11421) and also released proof-of-concept (PoC) code on his blog to demonstrate the vulnerability.

For more details about the Bad Taste vulnerability and its PoC ‚Äî Read More.


6. New Malware Exploits SambaCry to Hijack NAS Devices


Despite being patched in late May, the SambaCry vulnerability is currently being leveraged by a new piece of malware to target the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances.

SambaCry is a 7-year-old critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) in Samba networking software that could allow a hacker to remotely take full control of a vulnerable Linux and Unix machines.

The flaw was discovered and patched two months ago, but researchers at Trend Micro warned that the flaw had been actively exploited by the SHELLBIND malware that mostly targets NAS devices used by small and medium-size businesses.

For more detailed information on the SHELLBIND malware ‚Äî Read More.


7. Devil's Ivy ‚Äî Millions of Internet-Connected Devices At Risk

This week, researchers at the IoT-focused security firm Senrio discovered a critical remotely exploitable vulnerability in an open-source software development library used by major  IoT manufacturers that eventually left millions of smart devices vulnerable to hacking.

Dubbed Devil's Ivy, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-9765) in the gSOAP toolkit (Simple Object Access Protocol) ‚Äî an advanced C/C++ auto-coding tool for developing XML Web services and XML application.

The researchers also released proof-of-concept (PoC) video demonstrating the RCE on a security camera manufactured by Axis Communications.

For more detailed information on the Devil's Ivy and PoC video ‚Äî Read More.


8. ‚ÄúUbuntu Linux for Windows 10 Released‚Äù ‚Äî Sounds So Weird?

Downloading an entire operating system has just become as easy as downloading an application for Windows 10 users, as Microsoft last week announced the availability of popular Linux distro 'Ubuntu' in the Windows App Store.

While the company announced its plans to launch Fedora and SUSE Linux as well on Windows Store, the company did not reveal exactly when its users can expect to see these two flavours of Linux distro on the App Store.

For detailed information on how to install and run Ubuntu on Windows 10 ‚Äî Read More.


9. Over 70,000 Memcached Servers Vulnerable to Hacking


It's been almost eight months since the Memcached developers have patched several critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in the software, but tens of thousands of servers running Memcached application are still vulnerable.

Cisco's Talos intelligence and research group last year discovered three critical RCE vulnerabilities in Memcached ‚Äî a moderhttp://thehackernews.com/2017/07/segway-hoverboard-hacking.htmln open-source and easily deployable distributed caching system that allows objects to be stored in memory.

The vulnerability exposed major websites including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, to hackers, but the team of researchers scanned the internet on two different occasions and found that over 70,000 servers are still vulnerable to the attacks, including ransomware attacks similar to the one that hit MongoDB databases in late December.

For more in-depth information on the Memcached vulnerabilities ‚Äî Read More.


10. Tor Launches Bug Bounty Program for Public

WordPress, the most popular CMS in the world, is vulnerable to a logical vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to reset targeted users‚Äô password under certain circumstances.

The vulnerability (CVE-2017-8295) becomes even more dangerous after knowing that it affects all versions of WordPress ‚Äî including the latest 4.7.4 version.

The WordPress flaw was discovered by Polish security researcher Dawid Golunski of Legal Hackers last year in July and reported it to the WordPress security team, who decided to ignore this issue, leaving millions of websites vulnerable.

"This issue has been reported to WordPress security team multiple times with the first report sent back in July 2016. It was reported both directly via security contact email, as well as via<span class="highlight-match"> HackerOne </span>website," Golunski wrote in an advisory published today. "As there has been no progress, in this case, this advisory is finally released to the public without an official patch."
Golunski is the same researcher who discovered a critical vulnerability in the popular open source PHPMailer libraries that allowed malicious actors to remotely execute arbitrary code in the context of the web server and compromise the target web application.

The vulnerability lies in the way WordPress processes the password reset request, for the user it has been initiated.

In general, when a user requests to reset his/her password through forgot password option, WordPress immediately generates a unique secret code and sends it to user‚Äôs email ID already stored in the database.


What's the Vulnerability?

While sending this email, WordPress uses a variable called SERVER_NAME to obtain the hostname of a server to set values of the From/Return-Path fields.


Here, "From" refers to the email address of the sender and "Return-Path" refers to the email address where 'bounce-back' emails should be delivered in the case of failure in the delivery for some reason.

According to Golunski, an attacker can send a spoofed HTTP request with a predefined custom hostname value (for example attacker-mxserver.com), while initiating password reset process for a targeted admin user.

Since the hostname in the malicious HTTP request is an attacker-controlled domain, the From and Return-Path fields in the password reset email will be modified to include an email ID associated with the attacker's domain, i.e. wordpress@attacker-mxserver.com, instead of wordpress@victim-domain.com.

"Because of the modified HOST header, the SERVER_NAME will be set to the hostname of attacker's choice. As a result, Wordpress will pass the following headers and email body to the /usr/bin/sendmail wrapper," Golunski says.
Don't get confused here: You should note that the password reset email will be delivered to victim's email address only, but since the From and Return-Path fields now point to attacker's email ID, the attacker can also receive reset code under following scenarios:


If, in case, the victim replies to that email, it will be delivered to attacker email ID (mentioned in 'From' field), containing a password reset link in the message history.
If, for some reason, victim's email server is down, the password reset email will automatically bounce-back to the email address mentioned in "Return-Path" field, which points to the attacker's inbox.
In another possible scenario, to forcefully retrieve bounce-back email, the attacker can perform a DDoS attack against the victim's email server or send a large number of emails, so that the victim's email account can no longer receive any email.




"The CVE-2017-8295 attack could potentially be carried out both with user interaction (the user hitting the 'reply' button scenario), or without user interaction (spam victim's mailbox to exceed their storage quota)," Golunski told The Hacker News in an email.
For obvious reason, this is not a sure shot method, but in the case of targeted attacks, sophisticated hackers can manage to exploit this flaw successfully.

Another notable fact on which successful exploitation of this flaw depends is that, even if WordPress website is flawed, not all web servers allow an attacker to modify hostname via SERVER_NAME header, including WordPress hosted on any shared servers.

"SERVER_NAME server header can be manipulated on default configurations of Apache Web server (most common WordPress deployment) via HOST header of an HTTP request," Golunski says.
Since the vulnerability has now been publically disclosed with no patch available from the popular CMS company, WordPress admins are advised to update their server configuration to enable UseCanonicalName to enforce static/predefined SERVER_NAME value.

If you ever ordered food from Zomato, You should be Worried!

India's largest online restaurant guide Zomato confirmed today that the company has suffered a data breach and that accounts details of millions of its users have been stolen from its database.

In a blog post published today, the company said about 17 Million of its 120 Million user accounts from its database were stolen.


What type of information?

The stolen account information includes user email addresses as well as hashed passwords.



Zomato claims that since the passwords are encrypted, it cannot be decrypted by the attackers, so the "sanctity of your password is intact."

It seems Zomato is downplaying the threat or unaware of the fact that these days hackers are using cloud computing, which enables them to decrypt even a 15-18 character passwords within a few hours. So there's no guarantee your passwords will not eventually get cracked.

Update: As shown in the above screenshot taken immediately after they updated their blog post, Zomato has changed its statement from "your password can not be converted/decrypted" to "can not be easily converted" back to plain text.

The updated statement now reads:

"We hash passwords with a one-way hashing algorithm, with multiple hashing iterations and individual salt per password. This means your password cannot be easily converted back to plain text."
Also, Zomato stressed that the breach did not impact or compromise any payment card data, as the financial information of its customers is stored in a separate database different from the one illegally accessed.

"Payment related information on Zomato is stored separately from this (stolen) data in a highly secure PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) compliant vault. No payment information or credit card data has been stolen/leaked," the company claims.


17 Million Zomato Accounts Sold on Dark Web


According to HackRead, a user going by the online moniker of "nclay," who claimed to have hacked Zomato, is selling data of 17 Million registered Zomato users on a popular Dark Web marketplace.

The vendor also shared a sample data to verify the authenticity of the leaked database and is asking for 0.5587 Bitcoins (around $1017 or ‚Çπ65,261) for the entire set of data.

Though Zomato has partnered with<span class="highlight-match"> HackerOne </span>Bug Bounty Platform, hacker preferred to put up data on sale, which indicates it could be an internal breach, instead of exploiting a flaw. 

The company believes that someone from inside its organization is responsible for the security breach.

"Our team is actively scanning all possible breach vectors and closing any gaps in our environment. So far, it looks like an internal (human) security breach - some employee‚Äôs development account got compromised," the company said.


What should Zomato Customers do?

Customers should particularly be alert of any phishing email, which are usually the next step of cyber criminals after a breach to trick users into giving up further details like financial information.

For the obvious reasons, all customers are highly recommended to change their passwords for Zomato accounts as soon as possible, along with other websites that are using the same passwords, and choose unique passwords for different accounts.

If you can't create or remember complex passwords for different sites, you can make use of a password manager.

We have listed some good password managers for Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and Mac platform that could help you understand the importance of password manager and choose one according to your requirement.

Microsoft has finally launched a new dedicated bug bounty program to encourage security researchers and bug hunters for finding and responsibly reporting vulnerabilities in its latest Windows versions of operating systems and software.

Being the favourite target of hackers and cyber criminals, every single zero-day vulnerability in Windows OS‚Äîfrom critical remote code execution, mitigation bypass and elevation of privilege to design flaws‚Äîcould cause a crisis like recent WannaCry and Petya Ransomware attacks.

In past five years the tech giant has launched multiple time-limited bug bounty programs focused on various Windows features, and after seeing quite a bit of success, Microsoft has decided to continue.


"Security is always changing, and we prioritise different types of vulnerabilities at different points in time. Microsoft strongly believes in the value of the bug bounties, and we trust that it serves to enhance our security capabilities."

With its latest bug bounty program, Microsoft is offering up to $250,000 in rewards to cybersecurity researchers and bug hunters who find vulnerabilities in the company's software, which mainly focuses on:

Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 and Insider Previews
Microsoft Hyper-V
Mitigation Bypass Techniques
Windows Defender Application Guard
Microsoft Edge Browser

Below is the chart showing details of the targets, main focus areas and the respective payouts:


"In the spirit of maintaining a high-security bar in Windows, we‚Äôre launching the Windows Bounty Program on July 26, 2017," Microsoft says in a blog post. "The bounty program is sustained and will continue indefinitely at Microsoft‚Äôs discretion."

Recently, the non-profit group behind Tor Project joined hands with<span class="highlight-match"> HackerOne </span>and launched a bug bounty program with the payout of up to $4,000 to researchers and bug hunters for finding and reporting flaws that could compromise the anonymity network.

For more granular details about Microsoft's Bug Bounty Program, you can check out the program on the TechNet site.

The group of unknown hackers who hijacked CCleaner's download server to distribute a malicious version of the popular system optimization software targeted at least 20 major international technology companies with a second-stage payload.

Earlier this week, when the CCleaner hack was reported, researchers assured users that there's no second stage malware used in the massive attack and affected users can simply update their version in order to get rid of the malicious software.

However, during the analysis of the hackers' command-and-control (C2) server to which the malicious CCleaner versions connected, security researchers from Cisco's Talos Group found evidence of a second payload (GeeSetup_x86.dll, a lightweight backdoor module) that was delivered to a specific list of computers based on local domain names.


Affected Technology Firms¬†

According to a predefined list mentioned in the configuration of the C2 server, the attack was designed to find computers inside the networks of the major technology firms and deliver the secondary payload. The target companies included:

Google
Microsoft
Cisco
Intel
Samsung
Sony
HTC
Linksys
D-Link
Akamai
VMware

In the database, researchers found a list of nearly 700,000 backdoored machines infected with the malicious version of CCleaner, i.e. the first-stage payload, and a list of at least 20 machines that were infected with the secondary payload to get a deeper foothold on those systems.

The CCleaner hackers specifically chose these 20 machines based upon their Domain name, IP address, and Hostname. The researchers believe the secondary malware was likely intended for industrial espionage.


CCleaner Malware Links to Chinese Hacking Group

According to the researchers from Kaspersky, the CCleaner malware shares some code with the hacking tools used by a sophisticated Chinese hacking group called Axiom, also known as APT17, Group 72, DeputyDog, Tailgater Team, Hidden Lynx or AuroraPanda.

"The malware injected into #CCleaner has shared code with several tools used by one of the APT groups from the #Axiom APT 'umbrella'," tweeted director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab.
Cisco researchers also note that one configuration file on the attacker's server was set for China's time zone, which suggests China could be the source of the CCleaner attack. However, this evidence alone is not enough for attribution.

Cisco Talos researchers also said that they have already notified the affected tech companies about a possible breach.


Removing Malicious CCleaner Version would Not Help

Just removing the<span class="highlight-match"> Avast'</span>s software application from the infected machines would not be enough to get rid of the CCleaner second stage malware payload from their network, with the attackers' still-active C2 server.

So, affected companies that have had their computers infected with the malicious version of CCleaner are strongly recommended to fully restore their systems from backup versions before the installation of the tainted security program.

"These findings also support and reinforce our previous recommendation that those impacted by this supply chain attack should not simply remove the affected version of CCleaner or update to the latest version, but should restore from backups or reimage systems to ensure that they completely remove not only the backdoored version of CCleaner but also any other malware that may be resident on the system," the researchers say.
For those who are unaware, the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware, and affected users should update the software to version 5.34 or higher.

If you have downloaded or updated CCleaner application on your computer between August 15 and September 12 of this year from its official website, then pay attention‚Äîyour computer has been compromised.

CCleaner is a popular application with over 2 billion downloads, created by Piriform and recently acquired by<span class="highlight-match"> Avast,</span> that allows users to clean up their system to optimize and enhance performance.

Security researchers from Cisco Talos discovered that the download servers used by Avast to let users download the application were compromised by some unknown hackers, who replaced the original version of the software with the malicious one and distributed it to millions of users for around a month.

This incident is yet another example of supply chain attack. Earlier this year, update servers of a Ukrainian company called MeDoc were also compromised in the same way to distribute the Petya ransomware, which wreaked havoc worldwide.

Avast and Piriform have both confirmed that the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware.

Detected on 13 September, the malicious version of CCleaner contains a multi-stage malware payload that steals data from infected computers and sends it to attacker's remote command-and-control servers.


Moreover, the unknown hackers signed the malicious installation executable (v5.33) using a valid digital signature issued to Piriform by Symantec and used Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), so that if attackers' server went down, the DGA could generate new domains to receive and send stolen information.

"All of the collected information was encrypted and encoded by base64 with a custom alphabet," says Paul Yung, V.P. of Products at Piriform. "The encoded information was subsequently submitted to an external IP address 216.126.x.x (this address was hardcoded in the payload, and we have intentionally masked its last two octets here) via a HTTPS POST request."

The malicious software was programmed to collect a large number of user data, including:


Computer name
List of installed software, including Windows updates
List of all running processes
IP and MAC addresses
Additional information like whether the process is running with admin privileges and whether it is a 64-bit system.



How to Remove Malware From Your PC

According to the Talos researchers, around 5 million people download CCleaner (or Crap Cleaner) each week, which indicates that more than 20 Million people could have been infected with the malicious version the app.


"The impact of this attack could be severe given the extremely high number of systems possibly affected. CCleaner claims to have over 2 billion downloads worldwide as of November 2016 and is reportedly adding new users at a rate of 5 million a week," Talos said.
However, Piriform estimated that up to 3 percent of its users (up to 2.27 million people) were affected by the malicious installation.

Affected users are strongly recommended to update their CCleaner software to version 5.34 or higher, in order to protect their computers from being compromised. The latest version is available for download here.

	      Unpatchable 'DoubleAgent' Attack Can Hijack All Windows Versions ‚Äî Even Your Antivirus! [1.11 Points on average]

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:

<span class="highlight-match">
Avast </span>(CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)
Avira (CVE-2017-6417)
Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)
Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)
Comodo
ESET
F-Secure
Kaspersky
Malwarebytes
McAfee
Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

Are you sure the version of WhatsApp, or Skype, or VLC Player installed on your device is legitimate?

Security researchers have discovered that legitimate downloads of several popular applications including WhatsApp, Skype, VLC Player and WinRAR have reportedly been compromised at the ISP level to distribute the infamous FinFisher spyware also known as FinSpy.

FinSpy is a highly secret surveillance tool that has previously been associated with British company Gamma Group, a company that legally sells surveillance and espionage software to government agencies across the world.

The spyware has extensive spying capabilities on an infected computer, including secretly conducting live surveillance by turning ON its webcams and microphones, recording everything the victim types with a keylogger, intercepting Skype calls, and exfiltration of files.

In order to get into a target's machine, FinFisher usually uses various attack vectors, including spear phishing, manual installation with physical access to the device, zero-day exploits, and watering hole attacks.


Your ISP May Be Helping Hackers To Spy On You

However, a new report published today by ESET claimed that its researchers had discovered new surveillance campaigns utilizing new variants of FinFisher in seven countries, which comes bundled with a legitimate application.


But how is this¬†happening? Attackers are targeting victims using a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, where the internet service providers (ISP) are most likely operating as the "middle man"‚Äîbundling legitimate software downloads with FinFisher.

"We have seen this vector being used in two of the countries in which ESET systems detected the latest FinFisher spyware (in the five remaining countries, the campaigns have relied on traditional infection vectors)," the researchers say.
Previously published documents by WikiLeaks also indicated that the FinFisher maker also offered a tool called "FinFly ISP," which is supposed to be deployed on ISP level with capabilities necessary for performing such a MitM attack.

Also, the infection technique (using the HTTP 307 redirect) was implemented in the same way in the two affected countries ESET discovered being targeted by the new variants of FinFisher. However, the firm did not name the affected countries "as not to put anyone in danger."

Another fact which supports the ISP-level MitM attack is that all affected targets identified by the researchers within a country were using the same ISP.

"Finally, the very same redirection method and format have been used for internet content filtering by internet service providers in at least one of the affected countries," the ESET report reads.
The popular applications targeted by the new variants of FinFisher include WhatsApp, Skype, VLC Player,<span class="highlight-match"> Avast </span>and WinRAR, and the ESET researchers said, "virtually any application could be misused in this way."


Here's How The Attack Works:

When the target users search for one of the affected applications on legitimate websites and click on its download link, their browser is served a modified URL, which redirects victims to a trojanized installation package hosted on the attacker's server.

This results in the installation of a version of the intended legitimate application bundled with the surveillance tool.

"The redirection is achieved by the legitimate download link being replaced by a malicious one," the researchers say. "The malicious link is delivered to the user‚Äôs browser via an HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect status response code indicating that the requested content has been temporarily moved to a new URL."
This whole redirection process, according to researchers, is "invisible to the naked eye" and occurs without user's knowledge.


FinFisher Utilizing a Whole Lot of New Tricks

The new tricks employed by the latest version of FinFisher kept it from being spotted by the researchers.

The researchers also note that the latest version of FinFisher received several technical improvements in terms of stealthiness, including the use of custom code virtualization to protect the majority of its components like the kernel-mode driver.

It also makes use of anti-disassembly tricks, and numerous anti-sandboxing, anti-debugging, anti-virtualization and anti-emulation tricks, aiming at compromising end-to-end encryption software and known privacy tools.

One such secure messaging application, called Threema, was discovered by the researchers while they were analyzing the recent campaigns.

"FinFisher spyware masqueraded as an executable file named "Threema." Such a file could be used to target privacy-concerned users, as the legitimate Threema application provides secure instant messaging with end-to-end encryption," the researchers say.¬†

"Ironically, getting tricked into downloading and running the infected file would result in the privacy-seeking user being spied upon."
Gamma Group has not yet responded to the ESET report.

Is anything safe? It's 2017, and the likely answer is NO.

Making sure your passwords are secure is one of the first line of defense ‚Äì for your computer, email, and information ‚Äì against hacking attempts, and Password Managers are the one recommended by many security experts to keep all your passwords secure in one place.

Password Managers are software that creates complex passwords, stores them and organizes all your passwords for your computers, websites, applications and networks, as well as remember them on your behalf.

But what if your Password Managers itself are vulnerable?

Well, it's not just an imagination, as a new report has revealed that some of the most popular password managers are affected by critical vulnerabilities that can expose user credentials.

The report, published on Tuesday by a group of security experts from TeamSIK of the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology in Germany, revealed that nine of the most popular Android password managers available on Google Play are vulnerable to one or more security vulnerabilities.


Popular Android Password Manager Apps Affected By One Or More Flaws

The team examined LastPass, Keeper, 1Password, My Passwords, Dashlane Password Manager, Informaticore's Password Manager, F-Secure KEY, Keepsafe, and<span class="highlight-match"> Avast </span>Passwords ‚Äì each of which has between 100,000 and 50 Million installs.

"The overall results were extremely worrying and revealed that password manager applications, despite their claims, do not provide enough protection mechanisms for the stored passwords and credentials," TeamSIK said.
In each application, the researchers discovered one or more security vulnerabilities ‚Äì a total of 26 issues ‚Äì all of which were reported to the application makers and were fixed before the group's report went public.


Encryption Keys for Master Key Hard-Coded in the App's Code¬†

According to the team, some password manager applications were vulnerable to data residue attacks and clipboard sniffing. Some of the apps stored the master password in plain text or even exposed encryption keys in the code.

For example, one high severity flaw affected Informaticore's Password Manager app, which was due to the app storing the master password in an encrypted form with the encryption key hard coded in the app's code itself. A similar bug was also discovered in LastPass.

In fact, in some cases, the user's stored passwords could have easily been accessed and exfiltrated by any malicious application installed on the user's device.

Besides these issues, the researchers also found that auto-fill functions in most password manager applications could be abused to steal stored secrets through "hidden phishing" attacks.

And what's more worrisome? Any attacker could have easily exploited many of the flaws discovered by the researchers without needing root permissions.


List of Vulnerable Password Managers and Flaws Affecting Them

Here's the list of vulnerabilities disclosed in some of the most popular Android password managers by TeamSIK:


MyPasswords


Read Private Data of My Passwords App
Master Password Decryption of My Passwords App
Free Premium Features Unlock for My Passwords




1Password ‚Äì Password Manager

Researcher also going to present their findings at¬†HITB conference¬†next month. For more technical details about each vulnerability, users can head on to the TeamSIK report.

Since the vendors have addressed all these above-listed issues, users are strongly advised to update their password manager apps as soon as possible, because now hackers have all the information they require to exploit vulnerable versions of the password manager apps.

No More Ransom, so is the Ransomware Threat.

Launched less than a year ago, the No More Ransom (NMR) project has increased its capacity with new partners and new decryption tools added to its now global campaign to combat Ransomware.

Started as a joint initiative by Europol, the Dutch National Police, Intel Security and Kaspersky Lab, No More Ransom is an anti-ransomware cross-industry initiative to help ransomware victims recover their data without having to pay ransom to cyber criminals.

The online website not just educates computer users to protect themselves from ransomware, but also provides a collection of free decryption tools.

Since December, more than 10,000 victims from all over the world have been able to decrypt their locked up devices without spending a penny, using ransomware decryption tools available free of charge on this platform.

Statistics show that most of the website visitors were from Russia, the Netherlands, the U.S., Italy, and Germany.

The platform is now available in 14 languages and hosts 40 free decryption tools, supplied by a range of member organizations, which can be used by users to decrypt their files which have been locked up by given strains of ransomware.


No More Ransom initiative has been joined by thirty new organizations, including<span class="highlight-match"> Avast,</span> CERT Polska and Eleven Paths (the Telefonica Cyber Security Unit), which shows that the threat is a worldwide issue that needs to be fought together.

The initiative has also welcomed new law enforcement organizations from Interpol, Australia, Belgium, Israel, South Korea, Russia, and Ukraine.

Since December 2016, 15 new ransomware decryption tools have been added to the online portal by partner organizations, offering more decryption possibilities to the victims:


AVAST: Alcatraz Decryptor, Bart Decryptor, Crypt888 Decryptor, HiddenTear Decryptor, Noobcrypt Decryptor and Cryptomix Decryptor
Bitdefender: Bart Decryptor CERT Polska: Cryptomix/Cryptoshield decryptor
CheckPoint: Merry X-Mas Decryptor and BarRax Decryptor
Eleven Paths:¬†Telefonica Cyber Security Unit: Popcorn Decryptor.
Emsisoft: Crypton Decryptor and Damage Decryptor.
Kaspersky Lab: Updates on Rakhni and Rannoh Decryptors.


Previously available in English, Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese and Russian, the No More Ransom site has now added new languages including Finnish, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Slovenian, Spanish and Ukrainian.

More languages are also expected to be made available soon to assist victims across the world better.

The Shadow Brokers who previously stole and leaked a portion of the NSA hacking tools and exploits is back with a Bang!

The hacking group is now selling another package of hacking tools, ‚ÄúEquation Group Windows Warez,‚Äù which includes Windows exploits and antivirus bypass tools, stolen from the NSA-linked hacking unit, The Equation Group.

For those unfamiliar with the topic, The Shadow Brokers is a notorious group of black-hat hackers who, in August 2016, leaked exploits, security vulnerabilities, and "powerful espionage tools" created by The Equation Group.

On Saturday, the Shadow Brokers posted a message on their ZeroNet based website, announcing the sale of the entire "Windows Warez" collection for 750 Bitcoin (around US$678,630).

The data dump contains many windows hacking tools, categorized as following:

Fuzzing tools (used to discover errors and security loopholes)
Exploit Framework
Network Implants
Remote Administration Tools (RAT)
Remote Code Execution Exploits for IIS, RDP, RPC, SMB Protocols (Some Zero-Days)
SMB BackDoor (Implant)

Interestingly, the Remote Administration Tool (RAT) "DanderSpritz" included in the list is the one previously leaked in the NSA's documents revealed by Edward Snowden.

Besides this, malware researcher Jacob Williams analyzed the archive of "screenshots and output of the find command across the dump" provided by the hacker as an evidence of legitimacy and estimated that the tools may also include a Fully Undetectable Malware (FUD) toolkit.


The FUD toolkit might have an ability to "evade/bypass personal security products," such as Avira,<span class="highlight-match"> Avast,</span> Dr.Web, ESET Antivirus, Comodo, McAfee Antivirus, Microsoft Essential, Panda, Symantec, Trend Micro and Kaspersky Antivirus.

The buyers can purchase the entire database of hacking tools that The Equation Group used against various countries to expand its espionage operations.

In August, the Shadow Brokers announced an auction attempting to sell the complete set of tools to the highest bidder, but the group canceled their auction in October due to little or no response on their public sale.

But since this time the group has made Windows hacking tools up for sale, the chances are that hackers and espionage groups would be interested in buying these hacking tools.

Are you curiously googling or searching torrents for nude photos or videos of Emma Watson, Amanda Seyfried, Rose McGowan, or any other celebrities leaked in The Fappenning 2.0?

If yes, then beware, you should not click any link promising Fappenning celebrity photos.

Cybercriminals often take advantage of news headlines in order to trap victims and trick them into following links that may lead to websites containing malware or survey scams.

Last week, a few private photos of Emma Watson and Amanda Seyfried ‚Äî ranging from regular selfies to explicitly sexual photos ‚Äî were circulating on the Internet forums, including Reddit and 4chan, with UK's TV presenter Holly Willoughby and US actor Rose McGowan among the latest alleged victims.

Now, according to the security researchers from MalwareBytes, scammers are exploiting this new batch of leaked celebrity photos and videos by using their stolen selfies to lure victims on social media sites and making dollars.

One of the scam campaigns uncovered by MalwareBytes targets Twitter users, promising them to follow mentioned links to access leaked embarrassing private photos of British WWE star Paige ‚Äì whose intimate photos and videos, among other celebs, were leaked online last week without her permission in an act dubbed "The Fappening 2.0."
The Fappening 2.0 is named after similar leaks in 2014 when some anonymous hackers flooded the Internet with private photographs of Jennifer Lawrence, Kim Kardashian, Kate Upton and many hundreds of other celebrities by hacking their Apple's iCloud accounts.

Don't Install Any App To View Leaked Fappening Images ‚Äî It's a Malware!The latest scams spreading on Twitter read:
"VIDEO: WWE Superstar Paige Leaked Nude Pics and Videos""Incredible!!! Leaked Nude Pics and Videos of WWE Superstar Paige!!!!: [url] (Accept the App First)"For accessing the content, scammers told you to first install a twitter app called "Viral News." In the hope of a glimpse of Paige's nude video, victims tricked into giving the malicious app permission to access their Twitter account, update their profile and post tweets on their behalf.

Once the app is installed, you are then sent to a site that serves no purpose other than enabling crooks to make money from affiliate marketing and advertising link clicks.

The site quickly grays out, asking you to click yet another link that eventually lands you on a survey page that promises to reward you with an Amazon gift card as soon as you hand over your details.
"Suffice to say, filling this in hands your personal information to marketers ‚Äì and there is no guarantee you will get any pictures at the end of it," said Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at<span class="highlight-match"> Malwarebytes.</span>Malware Hijacks Twitter Accounts to Spread Fappening SpamWhile you are looking through all these links, the creepy app spams out the same tweets from your account, leading your followers to the same The Fappening 2.0 scam you fell for.

So far nearly 7,000 users have become a victim of the latest scam.
"As freshly leaked pictures and video of celebrities continue to be dropped online, so too will scammers try to make capital out of image-hungry clickers. Apart from the fact that these images have been taken without permission so you really shouldn‚Äôt be hunting for them, anyone going digging on less than reputable sites is pretty much declaring open season on their computers," Boyd concluded.Here are some useful tips you can follow in an effort to protect yourself from scams shared through social media:
Don't take the bait. Stay away from promotions of "exclusive," "shocking" or "sensational" photos or footage. If it sounds too outlandish to be true, it is probably a scam.
Hover over links to see their real destination. Before you click on any link, mouseover the link to see where it'll take you. Do not click on links leading to unfamiliar sites.
Don't trust your friends online. It might not actually be your friends who are liking or sharing scam links to photos. Their account may have been hijacked by scammers.
Raise your Eyebrows when asked for something in return. Beware of any site that asks you to download and install software in order to view anything else, in this case, nude photos and videos of Paige. This is a known tactic of spreading scam.

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

Also Read: Microsoft Started Blocking Windows 7/8.1 Updates For PCs Running New Processors

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:


Avast (CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)
Avira (CVE-2017-6417)
Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)
Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)
Comodo
ESET
F-Secure
Kaspersky<span class="highlight-match">
Malwarebytes
</span>McAfee
Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

Security researchers have discovered a rare piece of Mac-based espionage malware that relies on outdated coding practices but has been used in some previous real-world attacks to spy on biomedical research center computers.

Dubbed Fruitfly, the malware has remained undetected for years on macOS systems despite using unsophisticated and "antiquated code."

Infosec firm<span class="highlight-match"> Malwarebytes </span>discovered Fruitfly, detected as 'OSX.Backdoor.Quimitchin,' after one of its IT administrators spotted some unusual outgoing activity from a particular Mac computer.

According to the researchers, the recently discovered what they're calling "the first Mac malware of 2017" contains code that dates before OS X, which has reportedly been conducting detailed surveillance operation on targeted networks, possibly for over two years.

Fruitfly uses a hidden pearl script to communicate back to two command-and-control (C&C) servers and has the ability to perform actions like capturing webcam and screenshots from both Mac and Linux systems, grabbing the system's uptime, and moving and clicking a mouse cursor.

Fruitfly can also collect information about other devices connected to the same network as the infected Mac, and then tries to connect to them, according to a blog post published by Malwarebytes.

The malware also uses a secondary script and Java class to hide its icon from showing in the macOS Dock, though it's still unclear how the malware got distributed and infected the machines.

What's more interesting is that the malware uses code that pre-dates Apple's OS X operating system, including SGGetChannelDeviceList, SGSetChannelDevice, SGSetChannelDeviceInput, and SGStartRecord.

Researchers said the malware is even running open-source "libjpeg" code to open or create JPEG-formatted image files, which was last updated in 1998.

On further digging into the code, the researchers discovered the malware had even gone through changes to "support" Mac OS X Yosemite indicating Fruitfly is at least two years old.

However, the old code and upgrade to support Mac Yosemite do not indicate the exact creation date of the malware.

"The only reason I can think of that this malware has not been spotted before now is that it's being used in very tightly targeted attacks, limiting its exposure," Thomas Reed of Malwarebytes wrote in the post.¬†

"There have been [many] stories over the past few years about Chinese and Russian hackers targeting and stealing the United States and European scientific research. Although there is no evidence at this point linking this malware to a specific group, the fact that it has been seen specifically at biomedical research institutions certainly seems like it could be the result of exactly that kind of espionage."
The Fruitfly's code even includes Linux shell commands that show signs of the malware potentially running just fine on Linux operating system. So, it would come as no surprise if a Linux variant of Fruitfly was in operation.

Reed also said he has also come across related Windows executables that connected to the same C&C server used by the Fruitfly malware but date back to at least 2013.

However, the good news is that Apple has released an update for macOS to address Fruitfly. Although Apple automatically pushes the update, Mac users should consider checking their systems for infections, which is actually known as OSX.Backdoor.Quimitchip.

A massive malicious email campaign that stems from the Necurs botnet is spreading a new ransomware at the rate of 5 million emails per hour and hitting computers across the globe.

Dubbed "Jaff," the new file-encrypting ransomware is very similar to the infamous Locky ransomware in many ways, but it is demanding 1.79 Bitcoins (approx $3,150), which much higher than Locky, to unlock the encrypted files on an infected computer.

According to security researchers at Forcepoint Security Lab, Jaff ransomware, written in C programming language, is being distributed with the help of Necurs botnet that currently controls over 6 million infected computers worldwide.

Necurs botnet is sending emails to millions of users with an attached PDF document, which if clicked, opens up an embedded Word document with a malicious macro script to downloads and execute the Jaff ransomware,<span class="highlight-match"> Malwarebytes </span>says.


Jaff is Spreading at the Rate of 5 Million per Hour


The malicious email campaign started on Thursday morning at 9 am and had peaked by 1 pm, and its system recorded and blocked more than 13 million emails during that period ‚Äì that's 5 Million emails per an hour.

"Jaff targets 423 file extensions. It is capable of offline encryption without dependency on a command and control server. Once a file is encrypted, the '.jaff' file extension is appended," Forcepoint says.
The ransomware then drops a ransom note in every affected folder while the desktop background of the infected computer is also replaced.

The ransom note tells victims that their files are encrypted, but doesn‚Äôt ask them for any payments; instead, it urges victims to visit a payment portal located on a Tor site, which is accessible via Tor Browser, in order to get decrypt their important files.

Once victims install Tor Browser and visit the secret site, there they are then asked for an astounding 1.79 BTC (about $3,150).


Separate research conducted by Proofpoint researchers indicated that the Jaff ransomware could be the work of the same cybercriminal gang behind Locky, Dridex, and Bart.

The security company said that the Raff ransomware campaign had affected users globally with primarily victim organizations in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Mexico and Australia.


Massive Ransomware Attack Uses NSA's Windows Exploit

In separate news, another massive fast-spreading ransomware campaign is targeting computers at Hospitals, Banks, Telecom and Organisations across the globe today.

The ransomware, known as WanaCypt0r or WannaCry, is using NSA's Windows exploit, EternalBlue, which was leaked by Shadow Brokers hacking group over a month ago.

Within just hours this cyber attack has infected more than 60,000 computers in 74 countries.


How can you Protect yourself from the Jaff Ransomware?

To safeguard against such ransomware infection, you should always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent an email and should never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source.

Check if macros are disabled in your Microsoft Office applications. If not, block macros from running in Office files from the Internet. In enterprises, your system admin can set the default setting for macros.

To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC.

Moreover, make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your system, and most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

Many people believe that they are much less likely to be bothered by malware if they use a Mac computer, but is it really true? Unfortunately, No.

According to the McAfee Labs, malware attacks on Apple's Mac computers were up 744% in 2016, and its researchers have discovered nearly 460,000 Mac malware samples, which is still just a small part of overall Mac malware out in the wild.

Today, Malware Research team at CheckPoint have discovered a new piece of fully-undetectable Mac malware, which according to them, affects all versions of Mac OS X, has zero detections on VirusTotal and is "signed with a valid developer certificate (authenticated by Apple)."

Dubbed DOK, the malware is being distributed via a coordinated email phishing campaign and, according to the researchers, is the first major scale malware to target macOS users.

The malware has been designed to gain administrative privileges and install a new root certificate on the target system, which allows attackers to intercept and gain complete access to all victim communication, including SSL encrypted traffic.

Just almost three months ago,<span class="highlight-match"> Malwarebytes </span>researchers also discovered a rare piece of Mac-based espionage malware, dubbed Fruitfly, that was used to spy on biomedical research center computers and remained undetected for years.


Here's How the DOK Malware Works:


The malware is distributed via a phishing email masquerading as a message regarding supposed inconsistencies in their tax returns, tricking the victims into running an attached malicious .zip file, which contains the malware.

Since the malware author is using a valid developer certificate signed by Apple, the malware easily bypasses Gatekeeper -- an inbuilt security feature of the macOS operating system by Apple. Interestingly, the DOK malware is also undetectable in almost all antivirus products.

Once installed, the malware copies itself to the /Users/Shared/ folder and then add to "loginItem" in order to make itself persistent, allowing it to execute automatically every time the system reboots, until it finishes to install its payload.

The malware then creates a window on top of all other windows, displaying a message claiming that a security issue has been identified in the operating system and an update is available, for which the user has to enter his/her password.

Once the victim installed the update, the malware gains administrator privileges on the victim's machine and changes the victim system's network settings, allowing all outgoing connections to pass through a proxy.

According to¬†CheckPoint researchers,¬†"using those privileges, the malware will then install brew, a package manager for OS X, which will be used to install additional tools ‚Äì TOR and SOCAT."


DOK Deletes itself after Setting up Attacker's Proxy


The malware then installs a new root certificate in the infected Mac, which allows the attacker to intercept the victim‚Äôs traffic using a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack.

"As a result of all of the above actions, when attempting to surf the web, the user‚Äôs web browser will first ask the attacker web page on TOR for proxy settings," the researchers say.

"The user traffic is then redirected through a proxy controlled by the attacker, who carries out a Man-In-the-Middle attack and impersonates the various sites the user attempts to surf. The attacker is free to read the victim's traffic and tamper with it in any way they please."
According to researchers, almost no antivirus has updated its signature database to detect the DOK OS X malware, as the malware deletes itself once it modifies proxy settings on the target machines for interceptions.

Apple can resolve this issue just by revoking the developer certificate being abused by the malware author.

Meanwhile, users are always recommended to avoid clicking links contained in messages or emails from untrusted sources and always pay extra attention before proving your root password.


Update:¬†Apple Revokes Certificate Used By Dok Mac Malware


After this story had gone up, Apple responded to the issue and revoked the legitimate developer certificate used by hackers behind the DOK malware that can be used to eavesdrop on victim's communication, including secure HTTPS traffic.


MalwareBytes has confirmed this in its blog post, which reads: "Apple has already revoked the certificate used to sign the app, so, at this point, anyone who encounters this malware will be unable to open the app and unable to be infected by it."

It further adds: "If the user clicks past this warning to open the app, it will display a warning that the file could not be opened, which is simply a cover for the fact that no document opened, as shown above."

Besides this, Apple also rolled out an update this weekend to its XProtect built-in anti-malware software in an attempt to prevent existing and future DOK-type malware attacks.

Yes, even Mac could also get viruses that could silently spy on its users. So, if you own a Mac and think you are immune to malware, you are wrong.

An unusual piece of malware that can remotely take control of webcams, screen, mouse, keyboards, and install additional malicious software has been infecting hundreds of Mac computers for more than five years‚Äîand it was detected just a few months back.

Dubbed FruitFly, the Mac malware was initially detected earlier this year by<span class="highlight-match"> Malwarebytes </span>researcher Thomas Reed, and Apple quickly released security patches to address the dangerous malware.

Now months later, Patrick Wardle, an ex-NSA hacker and now chief security researcher at security firm Synack, discovered around 400 Mac computers infected with the newer strain of the FruitFly malware (FruitFly 2) in the wild.

Wardle believes the number of infected Macs with FruitFly 2 would likely be much higher, as he only had access to some servers used to control FruitFly.

Although it is unknown who is behind FruitFly or how the malware gets into Mac computers, the researchers believe the nasty malware has been active for around ten years, as some of its code dates back to as far as 1998.

"FruitFly, the first OS X/macOS malware of 2017, is a rather intriguing specimen. Selectively targeting biomedical research institutions, it is thought to have flown under the radar for many years," Wardle wrote in the abstract of his talk, which he is going to present at the Black Hat later this week.
Since the initial infection vector for FruitFly is unclear, like most malware, Fruitfly could likely infect Macs either through an infected website delivering the infection or via phishing emails or a booby-trapped application.

FruitFly is surveillance malware that's capable of executing shell commands, moving and clicking a mouse cursor, capturing webcam, killing processes, grabbing the system's uptime, retrieving screen captures, and even alerting the hacker when victims are again active on their Mac.

"The only reason I can think of that this malware has not been spotted before now is that it is being used in very tightly targeted attacks, limiting its exposure," Reed wrote in the January blog post.¬†

"Although there is no evidence at this point linking this malware to a specific group, the fact that it has been seen specifically at biomedical research institutions certainly seems like it could be the result of exactly that kind of espionage."
Wardle was able to uncover FruitFly victims after registering a backup command and control (C&C) server that was once used by the attacker. He then noticed around 400 Mac users infected with FruitFly started connecting to that server.

From there, the researcher was also able to see IP addresses of FruitFly infected victims, indicating 90 percent of victims were located in the United States.

Wardle was even able to see the name of victims' Macs as well, making it "really easy to pretty accurately say who is getting infected," he told Forbes.

But rather than taking over those computers or spying on the victims, Wardle contacted law enforcement and handed over what he found to law enforcement agents, who are now investigating the matter.

Wardle believes surveillance was the primary purpose of FruitFly, though it is yet unclear whether it is government or other hacker groups.

"This did not look like cyber crime type behaviour; there were no ads, no keyloggers, or ransomware," Wardle said. "Its features had looked like they were actions that would support interactivity‚Äîit had the ability to alert the attacker when users were active on the computer, it could simulate mouse clicks and keyboard events."
Since the Fruitfly's code even includes Linux shell commands, the malware would work just fine on Linux operating system. So, it would not come as a surprise if a Linux variant of Fruitfly was in operation.

	      How Dutch Police Decrypted BlackBerry PGP Messages For Criminal Investigation [1.06 Points on average]

The Dutch police have managed to decrypt a number of PGP-encrypted messages sent by criminals using their custom security-focused PGP<span class="highlight-match"> BlackBerry </span>phones and identified several criminals in an ongoing investigation.

PGP, or Pretty Good Privacy, an open source end-to-end encryption standard that can be used to cryptographically sign emails, files, documents, or entire disk partitions in order to protect them from being spied on.

You'll be surprised to know how the police actually decrypted those PGP messages.

In April last year, the Dutch Police arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of money laundering and involvement in selling customized BlackBerry Phones with the secure PGP-encrypted network to criminals that were involved in organized crimes.

At the time, the police also seized a server belonging to Ennetcom, the company owned by Danny Manupassa, which contains data of end-to-end encrypted communications belong to a large number of criminal groups.

Later, in January this year, the Dutch investigators claimed they could decrypt emails stored on PGP-encrypted BlackBerry devices using commercially available tools, but that only applied to phones in possession of authorities.

However, the latest news concerns reading all of the encrypted messages that were on the seized server.

Dutch police said they have accessed to the contents of 3.6 Million messages stored on that server, and that they even have managed to decrypt a number of messages, despite supposedly being protected with end-to-end encryption, announced Openbaar Ministerie (the Public Prosecution Service) in a press release on Thursday.

Decrypting messages gave authorities access to evidence for dozens of criminal investigations into assassinations, drug trafficking, money laundering, armed robbery, attempted murder and other organized crime, which can lead to significant, decisive breakthroughs in criminal matters.

But the question remains:


How did the Police Decrypt the PGP-encrypted Messages?

Ennetcom sold some 20,000 encrypted BlackBerry phones that came preloaded with a number of security features, including PGP email, which apparently means that the email content should be protected even if it's intercepted or if authorities search its server.

However, the Dutch authorities discovered that the Ennetcom PGP BlackBerry devices routed user communications through its own infrastructure, a Canadian court filing reads.

And here the blunder comes into play: The "keys" for the PGP encryption system were generated by the company's server, rather by the device.

As a result, the Dutch authorities noticed that the keys to decrypt the PGP encrypted messages on the Ennetcom PGP BlackBerry devices are also stored on Ennetcom's BlackBerry Enterprise Servers.

The authorities then discovered a total of 7TB of data on the central server of Ennetcom in Canada and found that it was possible to read encrypted messages on the server.

In response to the Openbaar Ministerie press release, Ennetcom announced on its website that "the public prosecution has done these seizures under false pretenses," based on suspicion of money laundering with the excuse as if all the phone customers are criminals.

The Dutch police arrested four suspects on Tuesday on suspicion of money laundering and involvement in selling custom encrypted<span class="highlight-match"> BlackBerry </span>and Android smartphones to criminals.

The Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), dedicated team within the Dutch National Police Agency aims to investigate advanced forms of cyber crimes, carried out investigation and found that the phone brand "PGPsafe" was selling customized BlackBerry and Android smartphones with the secure PGP-encrypted network to the "possible criminal end users."

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is an open source end-to-end encryption standard that can be used to cryptographically sign emails, documents, files, or entire disk partitions in order to protect them from being spied on.

Selling custom security-focused encrypted phones does not involve any crime itself, but Dutch police have discovered evidence, which indicates over the years such phones had been sold to organized criminals involved in assassinations, drug trafficking, money laundering, armed robbery, and attempted murder.

Just last year, the Dutch police arrested the owner of Ennetcom, a company that was also suspected of selling customized encrypted Blackberry Phones to criminals.

At that time, the police also seized Ennetcom servers based in the Netherlands and Canada, which contain data of encrypted communications belong to a large number of criminals.

Later in March this year, the police had even managed to decrypt a number of PGP-encrypted messages stored on the seized Ennetcom server and identified several criminals in an ongoing investigation.

In the latest case, the national Dutch police force Politie announced this Wednesday that it had arrested four suspects, including three men from Amsterdam and one from Almere, east of Amsterdam.

The Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD), a Dutch Anti-Fraud agency, along with the Public Prosecutor's Office, carried out raids at multiple places in the northern Dutch cities, including Amsterdam, Koggenland, Zandvoort and Zeewolde.

During raids, the police seized a house worth 600,000 Euros, a "mansion" with an estimated value of 1.6 million Euros, around 2 Million Euros in cash, thirteen vehicles, and hundreds of cell phones from phone brand "PGPsafe."

PGPsafe claims to sell: "The first PGP-provider which only works with products with the "Highest Grade Encryption" qualification. Therefore, we guarantee the privacy that you expect."



On 9th May, all PGPsafe users received a message on their phone from the Dutch police saying (translated version):

"This is the message from Dutch Police. Under the supervision from Ministery, Police have started a large-scale criminal investigation into the providers of PGPSafe.net Blackberry and Android systems, also used by you. The investigation also focuses on potential criminal end users."
According to the police, PGPsafe with over 40,000 registered customers sells PGP-encrypted Blackberry phones between ‚Ç¨ 1,200 and ‚Ç¨ 1,500 each, and transactions mostly took place through cash payments on the public highway.

The Dutch police hope to solve nearly 34 criminal investigations in and around the country, pending since 2014, by decrypting PGP-encrypted messages stored on the servers of such PGP smartphone companies.

The Dutch authorities are keeping a close watch on companies offering similar encrypted smartphones those are being abused by criminals and terrorists.

We have reached out to PGPsafe for a comment and will update this story when we hear back.

Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been appointed as a cyber security advisor for the President-elect Donald Trump, but it appears that he never actually checked the security defenses of his own company's website.

Giuliani is going to head a new Cybersecurity Working group for the President-elect, and "will be sharing his expertise and insight as a trusted friend concerning private sector cyber security problems and emerging solutions developing in the private sector," the Trump's Transition Team announced Thursday.

Trump administration has appointed Giuliani after citing his 16 years of experience "providing security solutions in the private sector," but the news met online criticism with many users on Twitter asking:

'What does the former New York mayor know about cyber security?'

As the news broke, online users started scanning his website "www.giulianisecurity.com" and found that the site for Giuliani Security & Safety is simply a disaster.

The site runs on an old version of Joomla! ‚Äî a free, open-source content management system (CMS) ‚Äî which is vulnerable to more than a dozen flaws.

The website also uses an outdated version of the script language PHP, uses an expired SSL certificate, runs over a 10-year-old version of FreeBSD OS server and even fails to follow other basic security practices.

According to Robert Graham of Errata Security, Giuliani did not build the site himself; instead he "contracted with some generic web designer to put up a simple page with just some basic content."

"There's nothing on Giuliani's server worth hacking. The drama over his security, while an amazing joke, is actually meaningless," Graham said in a blog post. "All this tells us is that Verio/NTT.net is a crappy hosting provider, not that Giuliani has done anything wrong."
Although it really doesn't matter who has created the website, if you are in cyber security business to "help the government plan to make us more secure," such ignorance hardly inspires confidence in the expertise of that person.

Giuliani is the CEO of his own private-sector cybersecurity venture, Giuliani Partners, which is an international cyber security consulting firm that claims to offer "a comprehensive range of security and crisis management services."

What Giuliani Partners actually does is not known, because the company promotes its crime reduction successes in countries, but not its cybersecurity work.

The venture recently struck a deal with<span class="highlight-match"> BlackBerry </span>to provide companies and governments cyber security support by assessing infrastructures, identifying potential cyber security vulnerabilities, addressing gaps and securing endpoints "with the goal of offering another channel to bring customers to a new standard of security."

This clearly suggests that the company is doing something right.

Much details about Giuliani's role in the Trump administration were not immediately available. We'll update the story with new developments.

Remember Ramona Fricosu? A Colorado woman was ordered to unlock her encrypted Toshiba laptop while the FBI was investigating alleged mortgage fraud in 2012, but she declined to decrypt the laptop saying that she did not remember the password.

Later the United States Court ruled that Police can force defendants to decrypt their electronic devices, of course, as it does not violate the Fifth Amendment that prevents any citizen from having to incriminate themselves.

Forgetting passwords for your electronic devices could be a smart move to avoid complying with a court order, but not every time, as US judges have different opinions on how to punish those who do not compel the order to unlock their phones.

On a single day last week, one defendant got six months jail for allegedly refusing to reveal his iPhone passcode, while a second defendant walks through after he claimed he forgot his passcode.

A Florida circuit court judge ruled last week that child abuse defendant Christopher Wheeler, 41, must serve 180 days in jail for not handing over the correct 4-digit code to unlock his iPhone to police, while he insisted that the passcode he gave to officers was correct.
"I swear, under oath, I've given [the detectives] the password," Wheeler said.Wheeler was arrested earlier this year for allegedly hitting and scratching his daughter. He was taken into custody in a Broward Circuit Court on Tuesday after the cops were not able to access the phone using the passcode provided by him.

Investigators believe that the defendants iPhone may contain photos of his child's injuries, according to the Miami Herald.

However, in a different court, another Florida judge let off an extortion case defendant, even though he also claimed to have forgotten the passcode for his<span class="highlight-match"> BlackBerry </span>phone.

Wesley Victor and his girlfriend Hencha Voigt (a reality TV personality) both are accused of threatening to release sex tapes stolen from local social media celeb YesJulz unless she paid $18,000.
"The judge made the right call," Victor's lawyer Zeljka Bozanic said. "My client testified he did not remember. It's been almost a year. Many people, including myself, can't remember passwords from a year ago."The sex tapes of YesJulz ended up on the Internet, but there is no evidence Victor or Voigt posted them online.

Voigt is also facing contempt of court charges and scheduled to appear in front of a judge next week because the passcode she provided to authorities for her phone was incorrect.

The Fifth Amendment gives defendants rights to not to say anything that could be used against them and a secret password or passcode is personal information protected by this amendment, but the above cases underscore the dilemma faced by law enforcement officials in dealing with the password and encryption issue.

It seems like the final word on passwords and encryption will likely have to come from the United States Supreme Court before.

Android has Fallen! Yet another set of Android security vulnerabilities has been discovered in Qualcomm chipsets that affect more than 900 Million Android smartphones and tablets worldwide.

What's even worse: Most of those affected Android devices will probably never be patched.

Dubbed "Quadrooter," the set of four vulnerabilities discovered in devices running Android Marshmallow and earlier that ship with Qualcomm chip could allow an attacker to gain root-level access to any Qualcomm device.

The chip, according to the latest statistics, is found in more than 900 Million Android tablets and smartphones.
 
That's a very big number.

The vulnerabilities have been disclosed by a team of Check Point researchers at the DEF CON 24 security conference in Las Vegas.


Critical Quadrooter Vulnerabilities:

The four security vulnerabilities are:

CVE-2016-2503 discovered in Qualcomm's GPU driver and fixed in Google's Android Security Bulletin for July 2016.
CVE-2016-2504 found in Qualcomm GPU driver and fixed in Google's Android Security Bulletin for August 2016.
CVE-2016-2059 found in Qualcomm kernel module and fixed in April, though patch status is unknown.
CVE-2016-5340 presented in Qualcomm GPU driver and fixed, but patch status unknown.

Qualcomm is the world's leading designer of LTE (Long Term Evolution) chipsets with a 65% share of the LTE modem baseband market. If any one of the four flaws is exploited, an attacker can trigger privilege escalations for gaining root access to an affected device.

All an attacker needs is to write a piece of malware and send it to the victim. When installed, the malware offers the attacker privilege escalation on the affected devices.

According to the researchers, the attack can also be conducted through a malicious app. An attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious app that, unlike other malware, would execute without requiring any special permission checks.

"Such an app would require no special permissions to take advantage of these vulnerabilities, alleviating any suspicion users may have when installing," Check Point researchers write in a blog post.
If any of the four vulnerabilities are successfully exploited, an attacker could gain root access to an affected device, giving the attacker full access to the device, including its data, camera and microphone.


List of Affected Devices (Popular)


More than 900 Million Android devices that ship with Qualcomm chip are vulnerable to the flaws.

Here's the list of some of the popular affected devices, though there are far more devices that are impacted by one or more Quadrooter vulnerabilities.

Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung S7 Edge
Sony Xperia Z Ultra
OnePlus One, OnePlus 2 and OnePlus 3
Google Nexus 5X, Nexus 6 and Nexus 6P
Blackphone 1 and Blackphone 2
HTC One, HTC M9 and HTC 10
LG G4, LG G5, and LG V10
New Moto X by Motorola<span class="highlight-match">
BlackBerry </span>Priv


How to Check if Your Device is Vulnerable?

You can check if your smartphone or tablet is vulnerable to Quadrooter attack using Check Point's free app.

Since the vulnerable software drivers, which control communication between Qualcomm chipset components, come pre-installed on these devices at the time of manufacturing, they can only be fixed by installing a patch from the devices' distributors or carriers after receiving fixed driver packs from Qualcomm.

"This situation highlights the inherent risks in the Android security model," the researchers say. "Critical security updates must pass through the entire supply chain before they can be made available to end users."
Three of the four vulnerabilities have already been fixed in Google's latest set of monthly security updates, and a patch for the remaining flaw will be rolled out in the upcoming September update.

Since Qualcomm has already released the code, the phone manufacturers could be able to issue patches to the individual devices as soon as possible.

Android Nexus devices are already patched via the over-the-air updates, but other smartphone models will need to wait until their lazy phone manufacturers integrate the fixes into their own custom Android ROMs.

Last week, a group calling itself "The Shadow Brokers" published what it said was a set of NSA "cyber weapons," including some working exploits for the Internet's most crucial network infrastructure, apparently stolen from the agency's Equation Group in 2013.

Well, talking about the authenticity of those exploits, The Intercept published Friday a new set of documents from the Edward Snowden archive, which confirms that the files leaked by the Shadow Brokers contain authentic NSA software and hacking tools used to secretly infect computers worldwide.

As I previously mentioned, the leaked documents revealed how the NSA was systematically spying on customers of big technology companies like Cisco,<span class="highlight-match"> Fortinet,</span> and Juniper for at least a decade.

Hacking tools from The Shadow Brokers leak named ExtraBacon, EpicBanana, and JetPlow, contain exploits that can compromise Cisco firewall products including devices from the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) line, PIX firewalls, and Cisco Firewall Services Modules (FWSM).

After a thorough investigation, Cisco confirmed the authenticity of these exploits, saying that these hacking tools contain exploits that leverage two security vulnerabilities affecting Cisco ASA software designed to protect corporate and government networks and data centers.


ExtraBacon Zero-Day Cisco Exploit

A zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2016-6366) leveraged by ExtraBacon Exploit resides in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco ASA software that could allow "an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system," Cisco explained in its advisory.

This leads to remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, enabling a remote attacker to take complete control over the device.

ExtraBacon was a zero-day exploit that was unknown to Cisco that left customers open to attack by hackers, in this case, NSA as well, who possessed the right hacking tools.

Besides ExtraBacon zero-day exploit, Cisco researchers also found a piece of code that tried to exploit an older Cisco bug (CVE-2016-6367) that was patched in 2011.

Also Read:¬†How NSA successfully Broke Trillions of Encrypted Connections.

The flaw resided in the command-line interface (CLI) parser of Cisco ASA software that allowed "an authenticated, local attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code [on the vulnerable device]," Cisco explained.

This flaw was included inside two NSA exploits, dubbed EPICBANANA as well as JETPLOW, which is an enhanced version of EPICBANANA, but with better persistence capabilities, Cisco's Omar Santos said in a blog post.


In addition, the leaked data contains files for decrypting Cisco PIX¬†Virtual Private Network (VPN) traffic, and implanting malware in computer motherboard firmware in such a way that it's almost impossible to detect or delete.

The multi-billion dollar tech firm has provided workarounds that addressed the vulnerabilities, though planned to release software updates to address the issues completely as soon as possible.


Fortinet says, Exploits Disclosed in 'NSA hack' are Legit

Meanwhile, another firewall equipment vendor, Fortinet, also warned of a high-risk vulnerability included in the EGREGIOUSBLUNDER exploit leaked by The Shadow Brokers, which affects older versions of its FortiGate firewalls.

The flaw resides in the onboard cookie parser buffer that could allow an attacker to take over an affected device by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.

Fortinet recommended its customers and businesses to upgrade to FortiGuard versions 5.x. However, Juniper has yet to issue security advisories based on the leaked files in the data dump.


Who is the 'The Shadow Brokers'? Russia? An Insider?

How the files containing exploits were leaked, and who exactly leaked it, are still unclear, but the recent developments made it very much clear that these exploits belong to the NSA and the agency was using them to target customers worldwide.

The Shadow Brokers' identity is still a mystery: As for now, multiple theories have been proposed.

Some are pointing their fingers towards Russia; some are saying it's an insider's job; while some say the NSA hacker using the hacking tools failed to clean up after an operation that allowed someone to grab them without compromising or hacking the agency.

Recently released NSA exploit from "The Shadow Brokers" leak that affects older versions of Cisco System firewalls can work against newer models as well.

Dubbed ExtraBacon, the exploit was restricted to versions 8.4.(4) and earlier versions of Cisco's Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) ‚Äì a line of firewalls designed to protect corporate, government networks and data centers.

However, the exploit has now been expanded to 9.2.(4) after researchers from Hungary-based security consultancy SilentSignal were able to modify the code of ExtraBacon to make it work on a much newer version of Cisco's ASA software.

Both Cisco and<span class="highlight-match"> Fortinet </span>have confirmed their firewalls are affected by exploits listed in the Shadow Brokers cache that contained a set of "cyber weapons" stolen from the Equation Group.

The Equation Group is an elite hacking group tied to the NSA's offensive Tailored Access Operations (TAO) and linked to the previous infamous Regin and Stuxnet attacks.


As previously reported, the ExtraBacon exploit leveraged a zero-day vulnerability in the Simple Network Messaging Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco‚Äôs ASA software that could allow "an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system" and take full control of a firewall.

However, newly released exploit means that ExtraBacon poses a dangerous threat than previously thought, as the modified exploit now does not prevent it from running on newer versions of Cisco firewalls, allowing an attacker to execute malicious code remotely.

"We have test equipment and custom firmware images that make debugging easier," Varga-Perke of SilentSignal told Ars. "These are most likely available for malicious parties, too; we are quite confident that similar code exists in private hands."
Cisco engineers have provided workarounds that help ASA customers detect and stop ExtraBacon-powered attacks, though the multi-billion dollar company has yet to release software updates to address the flaw completely.

Just like researchers modified the exploit code to make it work on newer version of Cisco products, the hacking tools and exploits dumped by the Shadow Brokers could be exploited by a wide range of hackers to carry out advanced attacks.

It seems like the NSA has been HACKED!

Update: The NSA Hack ‚Äî What, When, Where, How, Who & Why? Explained Here.

An unknown hacker or a group of hackers just claimed to have hacked into "Equation Group" -- a cyber-attack group allegedly associated with the United States intelligence organization NSA -- and dumped a bunch of its hacking tools (malware, private exploits, and hacking tools) online.

I know, it is really hard to believe, but some cybersecurity experts who have been examining the leak data, exploits and hacking tools, believe it to be legitimate.

Hacker Demands $568 Million in Bitcoin to Leak All Tools and Data

Not just this, the hackers, calling themselves "The Shadow Brokers," are also asking for 1 Million Bitcoins (around $568 Million) in an auction to release the 'best' cyber weapons and more files.

Widely believed to be part of the NSA, Equation Group was described as "a threat actor that surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques, and that has been active for almost two decades," according to a report published by security firm Kaspersky in 2015.

Equation Group was also linked to the previous infamous Regin and Stuxnet attacks, allegedly the United States sponsored hacks, though the link was never absolutely proven.

Two days back, The Shadow Brokers released some files, which it claimed came from the Equation Group, on Github¬†(deleted) and Tumblr.


Exploits for American & Chinese Firewalls Leaked:

The files mostly contained installation scripts, configurations for command-and-control (C&C) servers, and exploits allegedly designed to target routers and firewalls from American manufacturers including, Cisco, Juniper, and<span class="highlight-match"> Fortinet.</span>

According to the leaked files, Chinese company 'Topsec' was also an Equation Group target.

The leak mentioned names of some of the hacking tools that correlate with names used in the documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, like "BANANAGLEE" and "EPICBANANA."

"We follow Equation Group traffic," says the Shadow Broker. "We find Equation Group source range. We hack Equation Group. We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons. You see pictures. We give you some Equation Group files free, you see. This is good proof no? You enjoy!!! You break many things. You find many intrusions. You write many words. But not all, we are auction the best files."
It is yet not confirmed whether the leaked documents are legitimate or not, but some security experts agree that it likely is.

"I haven't tested the exploits, but they definitely look like legitimate exploits," Matt Suiche, founder of UAE-based cyber security firm Comae Technologies, told the Daily Dot.

While some are saying that the leak could be a very well-researched hoax, and the Bitcoin auction could be nothing but a distraction in an attempt to gain media attention.

"If this is a hoax, the perpetrators put a huge amount of effort in," security researcher The Grugq told Motherboard. "The proof files look pretty legit, and they are exactly the sorts of exploits you would expect a group that targets communications infrastructure to deploy and use."
However, if NSA has successfully been hacked, the hack would be a highly critical cyber security incident.

If you are a hacker, you might have enjoyed the NSA's private zero-day exploits, malware and hacking tools that were leaked last month.

But the question is: How these hacking tools ended up into the hands of hackers?

It has been found that the NSA itself was not directly hacked, but a former NSA employee carelessly left those hacking tools on a remote server three years ago after an operation and a group of Russian hackers found them, sources close to the investigation told Reuters.

The leaked hacking tools, which enable hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in systems from big vendors like Cisco Systems, Juniper, and<span class="highlight-match"> Fortinet,</span> were dumped publicly online by the group calling itself "The Shadow Brokers."

NSA officials have also admitted to the FBI that their careless employee acknowledged the error shortly afterward, and hence the agency was aware of its operative's mistake from last three years.

But instead of warning the affected companies that their customers were at risk, the NSA maintained the silence.

"After the discovery, the NSA tuned its sensors to detect [the] use of any of the tools by other parties, especially foreign adversaries with strong cyber espionage operations, such as China and Russia," Reuters reports.
Well, that's Bullshit! If they call it a 'tactic.'

Shortly after the public release of NSA cyber weapons, firewall vendors Cisco and Fortinet confirmed that the leaked zero-day vulnerabilities were legitimate and issued out patches to fix those exploits.

We are still waiting for the comments from the NSA, the FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence about the matter.

Since the initial leak of NSA's hacking tools last month and confirmation of the leaked vulnerabilities being legitimate by Cisco and Fortinet, the intelligence agency and online community has been finding out the working exploits in the data dump that are still unknown and used in the wild.

Just recently, Cisco revealed a new zero-day vulnerability from the leaked data dump that had been used by hackers to target some of its customers, which indicates that hackers would likely continue to take advantage of the now-exposed exploits to conduct cyber attacks.

Network equipment vendor Cisco is finally warning its customers of another zero-day vulnerability the company discovered in the trove of NSA's hacking exploits and implants leaked by the group calling itself "The Shadow Brokers."

Last month, the Shadow Brokers published firewall exploits, implants, and hacking tools allegedly stolen from the NSA's Equation Group, which was designed to target major vendors including, Cisco, Juniper, and<span class="highlight-match"> Fortinet.</span>

A hacking exploit, dubbed ExtraBacon, leveraged a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2016-6366) resided in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco ASA software that could allow remote attackers to cause a reload of the affected system or execute malicious code.

Now Cisco has found another zero-day exploit, dubbed "Benigncertain," which targets PIX firewalls.

Cisco analyzed the exploit and noted that it had not identified any new flaws related to this exploit in its current products.

But, further analysis of Benigncertain revealed that the exploit also affects Cisco products running IOS, IOS XE and IOS XR software.

Benigncertain leveraged the vulnerability (CVE-2016-6415) that resides in the IKEv1 packet processing code and affects several Cisco devices running IOS operating system and all Cisco PIX firewalls.

IKE (Internet Key Exchange) is a protocol used for firewalls, to provide virtual private networks (VPNs), and even manage industrial control systems.

A remote, unauthorized attacker could use this vulnerability to retrieve memory contents from traffic and disclose critical information such as RSA private keys and configuration information by sending specially crafted IKEv1 packets to affected devices.

"The vulnerability is due to insufficient condition checks in the part of the code that handles IKEv1 security negotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKEv1 packet to an affected device configured to accept IKEv1 security negotiation requests," Cisco said in its advisory.

Cisco's IOS operating system XR versions 4.3.x, 5.0.x, 5.1.x and 5.2.x, as well as PIX firewalls versions 6.x and earlier, are vulnerable to this flaw, though the company has not supported PIX since 2009.

Neither Cisco has developed a patch for the flaw, nor any workarounds are available.

The company said the vulnerability is currently under exploit, advising its customers to employ intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to help stop the attacks.

Cisco promised to release software updates to patch CVE-2016-6415 but did not specify a time frame.

Security researchers at ESET have discovered a new malware campaign targeting consulates, ministries and embassies worldwide to spy on governments and diplomats.

Active since 2016, the malware campaign is leveraging a new backdoor, dubbed Gazer, and is believed to be carried out by Turla advanced persistent threat (APT) hacking group that's been previously linked to Russian intelligence.

Gazer, written in C++, the backdoor delivers via spear phishing emails and hijacks targeted computers in two steps‚Äîfirst, the malware drops Skipper backdoor, which has previously been linked to Turla and then installs Gazer components.

In previous cyber espionage campaigns, the Turla hacking group used Carbon and Kazuar backdoors as its second-stage malware, which also has many similarities with Gazer, according to research [PDF] published by ESET.

Gazer receives encrypted commands from a remote command-and-control server and evades detection by using compromised, legitimate websites (that mostly use the WordPress CMS) as a proxy.


Instead of using Windows Crypto API, Gazer uses custom 3DES and RSA encryption libraries to encrypt the data before sending it to the C&C server‚Äîa common tactic employed by the Turla APT group.

Gazer uses code-injection technique to take control of a machine and hide itself for a long period of time in an attempt to steal information.

Gazer backdoor also has the ability to forward commands received by one infected endpoint to the other infected machines on the same network.

So far ESET researchers have identified four different variants of the Gazer malware in the wild, primarily spying on Southeast European and former Soviet bloc political targets.

Interestingly, earlier versions of Gazer were signed with a valid certificate issued by<span class="highlight-match"> Comodo </span>for "Solid Loop Ltd," while the latest version is signed with an SSL certificate issued to "Ultimate Computer Support Ltd."

According to researchers, Gazer has already managed to infect a number of targets worldwide, with the most victims being located in Europe.

Meanwhile, Kaspersky lab has also published almost similar details about Gazer backdoor, but they called it 'Whitebear' APT campaign.

Whenever we feel like the Locky ransomware is dead, the notorious threat returns with a bang.

Recently, researchers from two security firms have independently spotted two mass email campaigns, spreading two different, but new variants of the Locky ransomware.

Lukitus Campaign Sends 23 Million Emails in 24 Hours
The campaign spotted by researchers at AppRiver sent out more than 23 million messages containing Locky ransomware in just 24 hours on 28 August across the United States in what appears to be one of the largest malware campaigns in the second half of this year.

According to the researchers, the emails sent out in the attack were "extremely vague," with subjects lines such as "please print," "documents," "images," "photos," "pictures," and "scans" in an attempt to convince victims into infecting themselves with Locky ransomware.

The email comes with a ZIP attachment (hiding the malware payload) that contains a Visual Basic Script (VBS) file nested inside a secondary ZIP file.

Once a victim tricked into clicking it, the VBS file starts a downloader that downloads the latest version of the Locky ransomware, called Lukitus (which means "locked" in Finnish), and encrypts all the files on the target computer, and appends [.]lukitus to the encrypted data.

After encryption process ends, the malware displays a ransomware message on the victim's desktop that instructs the victim to download and install Tor browser and visit the attacker's site for further instructions and payments.

This Locky Lukitus variant demands a sum of 0.5 Bitcoin (~$2,300) from victims to pay for a "Locky decryptor" in order to get their files back.

This Lukitus attack campaign is still ongoing, and AppRiver researchers had "quarantined more than 5.6 million" messages in the campaign on Monday morning.

Sadly, this variant is impossible to decrypt as of now.

2nd Locky Campaign Sends over 62,000 EmailsIn separate research, security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Comodo </span>Labs discovered another massive spam campaign earlier in August, which sent out over 62,000 spam emails containing a new variant of Locky ransomware in just three days in the first stage of the attack.

Dubbed IKARUSdilapidated, the second variant of Locky ransomware has been distributed using 11,625 different IP addresses in 133 different countries‚Äîlikely made of a botnet of "zombie computers" to conduct coordinated phishing attacks.
According to security researchers at Comodo, "this is a large-scale, email-based ransomware attack in which a new Trojan malware variant appears as an unknown file and can slip into unsuspecting and unprepared organizations' infrastructures."The original attack that was first identified on August 9 and lasted three days utilized spam email messages that also contained a malicious Visual Basic Script (VBS) attachment, which if clicked, follows the same functioning as mentioned in the above case.

The cyber criminals operating Locky's IKARUSdilapidated variant demands ransom between 0.5 Bitcoin (~$2,311) and 1 Bitcoin (~$4,623) to get their encrypted files back.

This massive Locky ransomware campaign targets "tens of thousands" of users across the globe, with the top five countries being Vietnam, India, Mexico, Turkey, and Indonesia.

Here's How to Protect Yourself From Ransomware Attacks
Ransomware has become one of the biggest threats to both individuals and enterprises with the last few months happening several widespread ransomware outbreaks, including WannaCry, NotPetya, and LeakerLocker.

Currently, there is no decryptor available to decrypt data locked by above Locky ransomware variants, so users are strongly recommended to follow prevention measures in an attempt to protect themselves.

Beware of Phishing emails: Always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent via an email and never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source.

Backup Regularly: To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC.

Keep your Antivirus software and system Up-to-date: Always keep your antivirus software and systems updated to protect against latest threats.

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:


Avast (CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)
Avira (CVE-2017-6417)
Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)
Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)<span class="highlight-match">
Comodo
</span>ESET
F-Secure
Kaspersky
Malwarebytes
McAfee
Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

The Shadow Brokers who previously stole and leaked a portion of the NSA hacking tools and exploits is back with a Bang!

The hacking group is now selling another package of hacking tools, ‚ÄúEquation Group Windows Warez,‚Äù which includes Windows exploits and antivirus bypass tools, stolen from the NSA-linked hacking unit, The Equation Group.

For those unfamiliar with the topic, The Shadow Brokers is a notorious group of black-hat hackers who, in August 2016, leaked exploits, security vulnerabilities, and "powerful espionage tools" created by The Equation Group.

On Saturday, the Shadow Brokers posted a message on their ZeroNet based website, announcing the sale of the entire "Windows Warez" collection for 750 Bitcoin (around US$678,630).

The data dump contains many windows hacking tools, categorized as following:

Fuzzing tools (used to discover errors and security loopholes)
Exploit Framework
Network Implants
Remote Administration Tools (RAT)
Remote Code Execution Exploits for IIS, RDP, RPC, SMB Protocols (Some Zero-Days)
SMB BackDoor (Implant)

Interestingly, the Remote Administration Tool (RAT) "DanderSpritz" included in the list is the one previously leaked in the NSA's documents revealed by Edward Snowden.

Besides this, malware researcher Jacob Williams analyzed the archive of "screenshots and output of the find command across the dump" provided by the hacker as an evidence of legitimacy and estimated that the tools may also include a Fully Undetectable Malware (FUD) toolkit.


The FUD toolkit might have an ability to "evade/bypass personal security products," such as Avira, Avast, Dr.Web, ESET Antivirus,<span class="highlight-match"> Comodo,</span> McAfee Antivirus, Microsoft Essential, Panda, Symantec, Trend Micro and Kaspersky Antivirus.

The buyers can purchase the entire database of hacking tools that The Equation Group used against various countries to expand its espionage operations.

In August, the Shadow Brokers announced an auction attempting to sell the complete set of tools to the highest bidder, but the group canceled their auction in October due to little or no response on their public sale.

But since this time the group has made Windows hacking tools up for sale, the chances are that hackers and espionage groups would be interested in buying these hacking tools.

	      Chinese Certificate Authority 'mistakenly' gave out SSL Certs for GitHub Domains [0.95 Points on average]

A Chinese certificate authority (CA) appeared to be making a significant security blunder by handing out duplicate SSL certificates for a base domain if someone just has control over its any subdomain. 

The certificate authority, named WoSign, issued a base certificate for the Github domains to an unnamed GitHub user.

But How? First of all, do you know, the traditional Digital Certificate Management System is the weakest link on the Internet today and has already been broken?

Billions of Internet users blindly rely on hundreds of Certificate Authorities (CA) around the globe to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of their personal data.

But, these CAs have powers to issue valid SSL cert for any domain you own, despite the fact you already have one purchased from another CA. 

...and that's the biggest loophole in the CA system.

In the latest case as well, WoSign issued a duplicate SSL certificate for GitHub domains without verifying ownership of the base domain.

The incident was first publicly disclosed by British Mozilla programmer Gervase Markham on Mozilla's security policy mailing list saying the issue occurred over a year ago in July 2015 but went unreported.

"In June 2015, an applicant found a problem with WoSign's free certificate service, which allowed them to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of a subdomain," Markham wrote in the mailing list.
According to Markham, an unnamed security researcher accidentally discovered this security blunder when trying to get a certificate for 'med.ucf.edu' but mistakenly also applied for 'www.ucf.edu' and WoSign approved it, handing over the certificate for the university's primary domain.

For testing purpose, the researcher also used this trick against Github base domains i.e. github.com and github.io, by proving his control over a user-based subdomain.

...And guess what? WoSign handed over the certificate for GitHub main domains, too.

The researcher reported this issue to WoSign by giving only the Github certificate as an example. Thus, the Chinese CA only revoked the GitHub certificate, despite revoking both the certificates.

Why Just One? It is quite possible that the CA company doesn't have any tracking ability to discover and revoke all mistakenly issued base certificates for other domains by self-investigation even after getting informed of the problem.

The researcher recently got in touch with Google and reported that the ucf.edu cert had still not been revoked almost a year later.

How to check whether a rogue cert for your domain has been issued to someone else, probably a malicious attacker?



Solution: Certificate Transparency or CT, a public service that allows individuals and companies to monitor how many digital security certs have secretly been issued for their domains.

Certificate Transparency requires CAs to declare publicly (to Certificate Log) every digital cert they have generated. Even WoSign has participated in CT.

Certificate Log offers you a way to look up all of the digital certificates that have been issued for your domain name.

Although Certificate Transparency doesn't prevent CA from issuing forged certificates, it makes the process of detecting rogue certificates much easier.

Currently, Google, Symantec, DigiCert, and a few other CAs are hosting public CT logs. 

You can try Google's Certificate Transparency Lookup Tool or<span class="highlight-match"> Comodo'</span>s Certificate Transparency Search tool to check all certificates present in public Certificate Transparency logs that have been issued for your domain.

If you find a fraud certificate issued for your domain, report respective CA and address it immediately.

A severe security vulnerability has been discovered in the<span class="highlight-match"> CloudFlare </span>content delivery network that has caused big-name websites to expose private session keys and other sensitive data.

CloudFlare, a content delivery network (CDN) and web security provider that helps optimize safety and performance of over 5.5 Million websites on the Internet, is warning its customers of the critical bug that could have exposed a range of sensitive information, including passwords, and cookies and tokens used to authenticate users.

Dubbed Cloudbleed, the nasty flaw is named after the Heartbleed bug that was discovered in 2014, but believed to be worse than Heartbleed.

The vulnerability is so severe that it not only affects websites on the CloudFlare network but affects mobile apps as well.

What exactly is "Cloudbleed," how it works, how are you affected by this bug, and how you can protect yourself? Let's figure it out.


What is Cloudbleed?

Discovered by Google Project Zero security researcher Tavis Ormandy over a week ago, Cloudbleed is a major flaw in the Cloudflare Internet infrastructure service that causes the leakage of private session keys and other sensitive information across websites hosted behind Cloudflare.

CloudFlare acts as a proxy between the user and web server, which caches content for websites that sits behind its global network and lowers the number of requests to the original host server by parsing content through Cloudflare‚Äôs edge servers for optimization and security.

Almost a week ago, Ormandy discovered a buffer overflow issue with Cloudflare's edge servers that were running past the end of a buffer and were returning memory containing private data like HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, and HTTP POST bodies, with some of the leaked data already cached by search engines.


Here's How Serious is Cloudbleed:





"I'm finding private messages from major dating sites, full messages from a well-known chat service, online password manager data, frames from adult video sites, hotel bookings," Ormandy wrote in a blog post that was also published Thursday. "We're talking full HTTPS requests, client IP addresses, full responses, cookies, passwords, keys, data, everything."
According to Ormandy, Cloudflare had code in its "ScrapeShield" feature that did something similar to this:

int Length = ObfuscateEmailAddressesInHtml(&OutputBuffer, CachedPage);
write(fd, OutputBuffer, Length);
But the company was not checking if the obfuscation parsers returned a negative value because of malicious HTML.

The Cloudflare's "ScrapeShield" feature parses and obfuscates HTML, but since reverse proxies are shared among customers, it would affect all CloudFlare customers.

Ormandy contacted Cloudflare and reported it about his findings. The company identified the cause of the issue, and immediately disabled 3 minor Cloudflare features ‚Äî Email obfuscation, Server-side Excludes, as well as Automatic HTTPS Rewrites ‚Äî that were using the same HTML parser chain, which was causing the leakage.

Ormandy observed encryption keys, passwords, cookies, chunks of POST data, and HTTPS requests for the other leading Cloudflare-hosted websites from other users and immediately contacted Cloudflare.

Since CloudFlare patched the issue but did not notify customers by Wednesday of the data leak issue, Ormandy made public his findings on Thursday, following Project Zero's seven-day policy for actively exploited attacks.

Following Ormandy's public disclosure of the vulnerability on Thursday, CloudFlare confirmed the flaw, ensuring its customers that their SSL private keys were not leaked.

"Cloudflare has always terminated SSL connections through an isolated instance of NGINX that was not affected by this bug," Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cumming wrote in a blog post. "The bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it had been cached by search engines."

"We are disclosing this problem now as we are satisfied that search engine caches have now been cleared of sensitive information," he added. "We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence."


The Root Cause of Cloudbleed:

The root cause of the Cloudbleed vulnerability was that¬†"reaching the end of a buffer was checked using the equality operator and a pointer was able to step past the end of the buffer."¬†

 "Had the check been done using >= instead of == jumping over the buffer end would have been caught,"¬†said Cumming.

Cloudflare has also confirmed that the greatest period of impact was between February 13 and February 18 with almost one in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests via Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage, which is about 0.00003% of requests.

However, the researcher argued that the DNS provider was double-dealing, claiming that the Cloudbleed vulnerability had existed for months, based on Google's cached data.


How Does Cloudbleed Affect You?

There are a large number of Cloudflare's services and websites that use parsing HTML pages and modify them through the Cloudflare's edge servers.

Even if you do not use CloudFlare directly, that does not mean that you are spared. There is always a chance that websites you visit and web services you use may have been affected, leaking your data as well.

Of course, if you are using Cloudflare services in front of your site, the flaw could impact you, exposing sensitive information that flowed between your servers and end-users through CloudFlare's proxies.

While CloudFlare's service was rapidly patched the bug and has said the actual impact is relatively minor, data was leaking constantly before this ‚Äî for months.

Some of this leaked data were publicly cached in search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, who now removed it, but some engines like DuckDuckGo still host those data.

Also, other leaked data might exist in other services and caches throughout the Web, which is impossible to delete across all of these locations.


Cloudbleed Also Affects Mobile Apps

Cloudbleed also affects mobile apps, because, in many cases, the apps are designed to make use of the same backends as browsers for content delivery and HTTPS (SSL/TLS) termination.

Users on YCombinator have confirmed the presence of HTTP header data for apps like Discord, FitBit, and Uber by searching through DuckDuckGo caches with targeted search terms.

In an analysis conducted by NowSecure, the researchers have discovered some 200 iOS apps that identified as using Cloudflare services from a sampling of some 3,500 of the most popular apps on the app store.

There is always a possibility of someone discovering this vulnerability before Tavis, and may have been actively exploiting it, although there is no evidence to support this theory.

Some of the Cloudflare's major customers affected by the vulnerability included Uber, 1Password, FitBit, and OKCupid. However, in a blog post published by 1Password, the company assured its users that no sensitive data was exposed because the service was encrypted in transit.

However, a list of websites that have potentially been impacted by this bug has been published by a user, who go by the name of 'pirate,' on¬†GitHub, which also included CoinBase, 4Chan, BitPay, DigitalOcean, Medium, ProductHunt, Transferwise, The Pirate Bay, Extra Torrent, BitDefender, Pastebin, Zoho, Feedly, Ashley Madison, Bleeping Computer, The Register, and many more.

Since CloudFlare does not yet provide the list of affected services, bear in mind that this is not a comprehensive list.


What should You do about the Cloudbleed bug?

Online users are strongly recommended to reset their passwords for all accounts in case you have reused the same passwords on every site, as well as monitor account activity closely as cleanup is underway.

Moreover, customers who are using Cloudflare for their websites are advised to force a password change for all of their users.

Update: Uber representative reached out to me via an email and said their investigation revealed that the CloudBleed bug exposed no passwords of their customers. Here's the statement provided by Uber:

"Very little Uber traffic actually goes through Cloudflare, so only a handful of tokens were involved and have since been changed. Passwords were not exposed."

Meanwhile, DuckDuckGo spokesperson also reached out to The Hacker News and said the search engine has removed the leaked data from DuckDuckGo.

Do you believe that just because you have downloaded an app from the official app store, you're safe from malware?

Think twice before believing it.

A team of security researchers from several security firms have uncovered a new, widespread botnet that consists of tens of thousands of hacked Android smartphones.

Dubbed WireX, detected as "Android Clicker," the botnet network primarily includes infected Android devices running one of the hundreds of malicious apps installed from Google Play Store and is designed to conduct massive application layer DDoS attacks.

Researchers from different Internet technology and security companies‚Äîwhich includes Akamai,<span class="highlight-match"> CloudFlare,</span> Flashpoint, Google, Oracle Dyn, RiskIQ, Team Cymru‚Äîspotted a series of cyber attacks earlier this month, and they collaborated to combat it.

Although Android malware campaigns are quite common these days and this newly discovered campaign is also not that much sophisticated, I am quite impressed with the way multiple security firms‚Äîwhere half of them are competitors‚Äîcame together and shared information to take down a botnet.


WireX botnet was used to launch minor DDoS attacks earlier this month, but after mid-August, the attacks began to escalate.

The "WireX" botnet had already infected over 120,000 Android smartphones at its peak earlier this month, and on 17th August, researchers noticed a massive DDoS attack (primarily HTTP GET requests) originated from more than 70,000 infected mobile devices from over 100 countries.

If your website has been DDoSed, look for the following pattern of User-Agent strings to check if it was WireX botnet: 


After further investigation, security researchers identified more than 300 malicious apps on Google‚Äôs official Play Store, many of which purported to be media, video players, ringtones, or tools for storage managers and app stores, which include the malicious WireX code.

Just like many malicious apps, WireX apps do not act maliciously immediately after the installation in order to evade detection and make their ways to Google Play Store.

Instead, WireX apps wait patiently for commands from its command and control servers located at multiple subdomains of "axclick.store."

Google has identified and already blocked most of 300 WireX apps, which were mostly downloaded by users in Russia, China, and other Asian countries, although the WireX botnet is still active on a small scale.


If your device is running a newer version of the Android operating system that includes Google's Play Protect feature, the company will automatically remove WireX apps from your device, if you have one installed.

Play Protect is Google's newly launched security feature that uses machine learning and app usage analysis to remove (uninstall) malicious apps from users Android smartphones to prevent further harm.

Also, it is highly recommended to install apps from reputed and verified developers, even when downloading from Google official Play Store and avoid installing unnecessary apps.

Additionally, you are strongly advised to always keep a good antivirus app on your mobile device that can detect and block malicious apps before they can infect your device, and always keep your device and apps up-to-date.

Android malware continues to evolve with more sophisticated and never-seen-before attack vectors and capabilities with every passing day.

Just at the beginning of this week, Google removed over 500 Android apps utilising the rogue SDK‚Äîthat secretly distribute spyware to users‚Äîfrom its Play Store marketplace.

Last month, we also saw first Android malware with code injecting capabilities making rounds on Google Play Store.

A few days after that, researchers discovered another malicious Android SDK ads library, dubbed "Xavier," found installed on more than 800 different apps that had been downloaded millions of times from Google Play Store.

During the 2016 presidential election campaign, we reported about how insecure was the mail servers operated by the Trump organization that anyone with little knowledge of computers can expose almost everything about Trump and his campaign.

Now, some unknown hackers calling themselves "Pro_Mast3r" managed to deface an official website associated with President Donald Trump's presidential campaign fundraising on Sunday.

The hacker, claiming to be from Iraq, reportedly defaced the server, secure2.donaldjtrump.com, which is behind<span class="highlight-match"> CloudFlare'</span>s content management system and security platform.

The server appears to be an official Trump campaign server, reported Ars, as the certificate of the server is legitimate, "but a reference to an image on another site is insecure, prompting a warning on Chrome and Firefox that the connection is not secure."

The defaced website displayed an image of a black hat man and included a text message, which reads:

Hacked by Pro_Mast3r ~
Attacker Gov
Nothing Is Impossible
Peace From Iraq

At the time of writing, the server is now offline, and there is no official statement from Trump-Pence campaign team yet.

According to a blog post published by Italian IT journalist Paolo Attivissimo, the source code of the defaced server does not contain any malicious script.

Instead, the server includes a link to javascript on a now-nonexistent Google Code account, 'masterendi,' which was linked to cyber attacks on three other sites in the past.

A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for a critical vulnerability in the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) has been publically released that could allow anyone to crash a server with just a single maliciously crafted packet.

The vulnerability has been patched by the Network Time Foundation with the release of NTP 4.2.8p9, which includes a total of 40 security patches, bug fixes, and improvements.

The NTP daemon is used in almost every device that needs to synchronize time on computer clocks. NTP got the most attention in late 2014 and 2015 when hackers used it to launch highly amplified DDoS attacks against services.

The flaw which affects NTP.org's nptd versions prior to 4.2.8p9, but not including ntp-4.3.94, has been discovered by security researcher Magnus Stubman, who privately disclosed it to the Network Time Foundation on June 24.

A patch for the vulnerability was developed and sent to Stubman on 29th September and just two days later, the researcher acknowledged that it mitigated the issue. And now he went with the public disclosure.

"The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to crash ntpd with a single malformed UDP packet, which causes a null pointer dereference," Stubman wrote in an advisory published Monday.
Stubman also released a PoC exploit that can crash the NTP daemon and creates a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The issue only affects Windows.

Besides Stubman's high severity vulnerability, the latest NTP update also addresses two medium severity bugs, two medium-low severity, and five low-severity security issues; 28 bug fixes, and contains other improvements over 4.2.8p8.

Another major bug is a trap-crash vulnerability reported by Cisco's Matthew Van Gundy.

"If trap service has been explicitly enabled, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service," reads the advisory.
CERT at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University has also released the full list of the vulnerabilities in NTP and fixes. It also listed some vendors that implement NTP and could be affected by the bugs.

Since the exploit for the severe bug is available to the public, administrators are strongly recommended to patch their NTP implementations as soon as possible.

In the past, we have seen hackers abusing the NTP servers by sending small spoofed UDP packets to the vulnerable server that requests a significant amount of data (megabytes worth of traffic) to be sent to the DDoS's target IP Address.

Above 400 Gbps NTP amplification¬†DDoS Attack was carried out against content-delivery and anti-DDoS protection firm<span class="highlight-match"> CloudFlare,</span> and volumetric DDoS attacks exceeding 100 Gbps against popular Gaming services, including League of Legends, EA.com, and Battle.net from Blizzard in 2014.

In a study conducted by Arbor Networks in late 2013, the researchers illustrated the effectiveness of NTP amplification attacks that are massive and efficient to take any large server offline because they reflect 1,000 times the size of the initial query back to the target.

UPDATE: The site is back and working. Blockchain team released a statement via Twitter, which has been added at the end of this article.

If you are fascinated with the idea of digital currency, then you might have heard about BlockChain.Info.

It‚Äôs Down!

Yes, Blockchain.info, the world's most popular Bitcoin wallet and Block Explorer service, has been down from last few hours, and it's believed that a possible cyber attack has disrupted the site.

The site is down at the time of writing, and the web server reports a bad gateway error, with a message on the website that reads:

"Looks like our site is down. We're working on it and should be back up soon."
With more than 8 million Digital Wallet customers, BlockChain is users' favorite destination to see recent transactions, stats on mined blocks and bitcoin economy charts.



A few hours ago, BlockChain team tweeted about the sudden breakdown of the site, saying: "We're researching a DNS issue and looking into it. We apologize for the inconvenience. Stay tuned."

 "We're making progress resolving the issue, but it may take upwards of several hours until services are fully restored," another tweet reads.

However, a Reddit user has noted that "The whois and DNS records suddenly jumped from<span class="highlight-match"> CloudFlare </span>to a cheap web host."

It seems that their domain name has been hijacked, which was later confirmed by the BlockChain team on Reddit, saying:

"Hey everyone, our DNS provider was targeted. It's going to be several hours before our services are fully restored. The CloudFlare DNS is propagating now."
Until resolved, which may take next few hours, Blockchain.info digital wallet users would not be able to access their online accounts. In response to this incident, Blockchain users are in hopes that their online wallet has not been hacked or funds stolen.

Since its DNS server has been hijacked, it could be possible that an attacker can host a fake web page on the same domain in an effort to steal your bitcoin wallet credentials.

So, Blockchain users are strongly recommended not to log in to the site until the Blockchain team releases an official statement via its Twitter account.


Official Statement From BlockChain:

"Earlier today, we discovered our DNS registrar had been compromised. We took immediate action to resolve the issue. To be abundantly cautious, we‚Äôre waiting for the DNS to propagate universally across the web before bringing our services back. Once DNS has propagated, we expect to restore services ASAP. Our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience."
However, there is no statement from the Blockchain.info team that suggests any hacking or compromise of its users bitcoin wallets.

Wi-Fi enabled devices ‚Äî widely known as the Internet of Things (IoT) ‚Äî are populating offices and homes in greater and greater numbers.

From smartphones to connected printers and even coffee makers, most of these IoT devices have good intentions and can connect to your company's network without a problem.

However, as the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are growing at a great pace, they continue to widen the attack surface at the same time, giving attackers a large number of entry points to affect you some or the other way.

The attackers can use your smart devices to gain backdoor entry to your network, giving them the capability to steal sensitive data, such as your personal information, along with a multitude of other malicious acts.

An interesting attack scenario has recently been demonstrated by one of the renowned hackers, Jayson Street, who said all it is needed is to walk around with the right device to get into someone's device.

Before we jump into the technical details of the attack, let's watch out a video showing that how easy it is to hack smartphones and laptops in a crowded place by setting up an EvilAP (malicious access point).


Here's How the Attack Works:


Street used a simple penetration testing device and an internet connection to pwn people around him.

Technically, Street hacking device automatically set up an 'Evil Twin Attack,' in which an attacker fools wireless users into connecting their smartphones and laptops to an evil (malicious) hotspot by posing as a legitimate WiFi provider.

Once connected, all of the victim's information flows directly into the attacker's device, allowing cybercriminals to secretly eavesdrop on the network traffic and steal passwords, financial and other sensitive data and even redirect you to malware and phishing sites.


How to Prevent Evil Twin WiFi Attacks
<span class="highlight-match">
Pwnie Express </span>released its yearly industry report: Internet of Evil Things, providing insight on products that the IT professionals should be wary of.

Using the report and additional information from security researchers at Pwnie, we have listed five quick steps you can implement in order to prevent yourself or your workplace from being compromised.

1. Turn your WiFi Off: Turn off Wi-Fi devices when you are not using them, especially on the weekends ‚Äî it saves energy and minimizes your exposure to hackers.

2. Use it or Lose it: Once the product is in your office, turn off the functions you aren't using. Enabled functionality usually comes with increased security risks.

Also, make sure you review the products before you bring them into the workplace. If it is already there, do not be shy about calling customer service and walking through the steps required to shut down any unused functions.

3. Change Your Passwords: It is important never to use the default credentials. Set up strong, secure passwords to secure your devices.

4. Research Your Purchase: Before you even buy a product, always research what you're buying and make sure you know how to update any software associated with that device.

Look for devices, systems, and services that make it easy to upgrade the device and inform the end user when updates are available.

5. Trust and Verify Every Device: Be aware of any device from brands known to have more security issues than others. The personalization of corporate hardware, including mobile hotspot vendors, is one of the top threats to network security.

Bluetooth Low Energy, also known as Bluetooth Smart or Bluetooth 4, is the leading protocol designed for connecting IoT devices, medical equipment, smart homes and like most emerging technologies, security is often an afterthought.

As devices become more and more embedded in our daily lives, vulnerabilities have real impact on our digital and physical security.

Enter the Bluetooth lock, promising digital key convenience with temporary and Internet shareable access. The problem is, almost all of these locks have vulnerabilities, easily exploited via Bluetooth!

DEF CON always has the coolest new hacks and security news, and this year was no exception. The hacking conferences are a great way to get a pulse on the general status of the security world, what people are interested in, worried about, or looking to exploit.

This year clearly had an uptick in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and ways to hack them.

Obviously, we had to go and take a look at the Bluetooth lock hack, and we are not the only ones.

There were articles in a number of security and general tech sites about how vulnerable some of these locks are ‚Äì a shocking 75% of them could be hacked relatively easily, and one reported to have great security could actually be broken into with a screwdriver.

The locks were from companies like BlueLock, Kwikset, Noke, August, BitLock, and QuickLock.

How to Hack a Bluetooth Lock:There have been a number of different researchers who have tackled this problem, but Anthony Rose and Ben Ramsay out of Merculite Security did a great job of thoroughly going through a significant number of them, documenting the hacks and contacting the manufacturers.
Look for plaintext passwords: Many of the locks had passwords but were simply transmitting them in plaintext. Anyone with a decent Bluetooth sniffer like Ubertooth and some effort has just owned your password
Replay the signal: OK, great you‚Äôve built in awesome encryption and I can't possibly hope to read and decrypt the signal you just sent to that lock. But I just capture and replay what you just sent, and the door opens wide.
Man in the Middle: Here I am, using one of the many Man in the Middle tools to sit in the middle of your connection and control everything you're transmitting to the device. There's *definitely* no way I could change what you‚Äôre transmitting (say, to keep the deadbolt from hearing a "lock" command).
The great news is that we found a video of Zero_Chaos and Granolocks at<span class="highlight-match"> Pwnie Express </span>that show all of this stuff in action and tools you can actually use to detect these hacks in action.

Locks are not the only Bluetooth devices shown to be vulnerable. Here‚Äôs a quick list of just some of the devices that have already been found vulnerable:
Cars
Teakettles and coffee machines
Medical devices (including implanted ones)
Fitness trackers
This news should be worrying for people who have invested in a cheap Bluetooth lock for their convenience, and such attacks could be a real problem just waiting to happen.

It‚Äôs 2017, and we‚Äôre not any further along with Wi-Fi security than we were 10 years ago. There are Intrusion Detection Systems and 2nd generation antivirus apps to protect us from some vulnerabilities but the simple fact that some people and businesses still don‚Äôt set their network up well in the first place.

Installing WiFi is like running Ethernet to your parking lot. It‚Äôs a cliche thing to say, but it is often true.

If I can attack your network sitting in my car from the parking lot, what chance do you have? And 99% of the time I‚Äôm successful.

Lots of companies are moving to new offices that have wide open office layouts. Some may not have BYOD policies or wireless security plans in place, and anyone can bring their own device to work that you may not know about.

I‚Äôve even seen some companies installing IoT devices like smart led light bulbs and thermostats.  Even some security camera systems which are always running unsecured and default passwords.

So what can you do to protect people like me from exploiting weaknesses in your wireless security networks and PWNing your company?


We're sorry, but your new password must contain an upper case letter, a number, a punctuation mark and a gang sign üò≥ü§î
‚Äî<span class="highlight-match"> Pwnie Express </span>(@PwnieExpress) January 16, 2017


Be sure WEP does not exist in your infrastructure. WEP is the weakest of the weak for encryption but was a reaction to open networks early on. If enough packets are observed the key can be brute forced easily. Remember doing that like 15 years ago?
WPA/WPA2 PSK can be your friend. It‚Äôs mostly secure, but there are still things you need to lock down to be sure.
Create a plan on what to do when an attack happens. Develop and implement a wireless security policy. Be ready when you do detect a rogue device or when someone‚Äôs banging on your network from the parking lot.


Want to watch us talk about penetration testing and hear stories from 200 clients I‚Äôve been hired to hack into their network?

We‚Äôre running a webinar tomorrow with Pwnie Express and Larry Pesce.


You can sign up here, and I‚Äôll send you the link to watch us as well as a guide for 2017 on how you can lock down wireless networks and keep people like me out of your company's networks.

Note: It's a guest post written by¬†Ken Savage from Pwnie Express for The Hacker News.

In this week‚Äôs episode, Elliot uses a<span class="highlight-match"> Pwnie Express </span>Pwn Phone, which he describes as ‚Äúa dream device for pentester,‚Äù to run a custom script he has written to take over someone else‚Äôs phone.

Security pros have long know about the Pwn Phone as a powerful mobile platform for penetration testing and security assessments, so it is not surprising to see it on Mr. Robot.

The coolest part is that Pwnie Express is giving away a Pwn Phone, just like the one used in the show.

The Pwn Phone is a mobile pentesting device that makes it incredibly easy to evaluate wired, wireless and Bluetooth networks. It is built on Kali Linux that comes pre-packaged with over 100 built-in and ‚Äòone-click‚Äô tools, and it can run third-party scripts.

The Pwn Pad exists for security pros who want a tablet version, and it‚Äôs also available via the Android Open Pwn Project.

The Pwn Phone is the latest in a series of connected device hacks on Mr. Robot that have included a Femtocell, a Raspberry Pi, and Bluetooth sniffers, along with the hack of an E-Corp exec‚Äôs connected home and the crucial meltdown of E-Corp‚Äôs data center by using a connected HVAC system.

These are real threats that are being exploited by criminals to gain unauthorized access and steal data from companies today.

In the past, Pwnie has made it clear that they do not condone the criminal use of penetration testing tools and devices. But pentesting is important, and having the tools to do it properly is part of that process.

Sometimes you need to break things to find and fix serious security vulnerabilities in the devices and networks that permeate nearly every facet of our daily lives. The bad guys have every tool available to them; white hats should be equally well-equipped.

And as for what Elliot does in the show?

He‚Äôs a pretty well-established gray character. Is he good? Or is he bad?

Either way, it was pretty cool.

Security researchers have discovered over a dozen of vulnerabilities in tens of thousands of web-connected cameras that can not be protected just by changing their default credentials.

Vulnerabilities found in two models of IP cameras from China-based manufacturer Foscam allow attackers to take over the camera, view video feeds, and, in some cases, even gain access to other devices connected to a local network.

Researchers at security firm<span class="highlight-match"> F-Secure </span>discovered 18 vulnerabilities in two camera models ‚Äî one sold under the Foscam C2 and other under Opticam i5 HD brand ‚Äî that are still unpatched despite the company was informed several months ago.

In addition to the Foscam and Opticam brands, F-Secure also said the vulnerabilities were likely to exist in 14 other brands that use Foscam internals, including Chacon, 7links, Netis, Turbox, Thomson, Novodio, Nexxt, Ambientcam, Technaxx, Qcam, Ivue, Ebode and Sab.

The flaws discovered in the IP cameras includes:

Insecure default credentials
Hard-coded credentials
Hidden and undocumented Telnet functionality
Remote Command Injections
Incorrect permissions assigned to programming scripts
Firewall leaking details about the validity of credentials
Persistent cross-site scripting
Stack-based Buffer overflow attack


Changing Default Credentials Won't Help You


Usually, users are always advised to change the default credentials on their smart devices, but in this case, Foscan is using hard-coded credentials in cameras, so attackers could bypass passwords even if users set a unique one.

"Credentials that have been hard-coded by the manufacturer cannot be changed by the user. If the password is discovered and published on the internet (which often happens) attackers can gain access to the device. And as all devices have the same password, malware attacks such as worms can easily spread between devices," reads a report [PDF] released Wednesday by F-Secure.
These issues could allow an attacker to perform a wide range of attacks, which includes gaining unauthorized access to a camera, accessing private videos, performing remote command injection attacks, using compromised IP cameras for DDoS or other malicious activities, and compromising other devices in the same network.

Hidden and undocumented Telnet functionality could help attackers use Telnet to discover "additional vulnerabilities in the device and within the surrounding network."


Gaining Persistent Remote Access to the Affected Camera

Three vulnerabilities, including built-in file transfer protocol server that contains an empty password that can't be changed by the user, a hidden telnet function and incorrect permissions assigned to programming scripts, could be exploited by attackers to gain persistent remote access to the device.

"The empty password on the FTP user account can be used to log in. The hidden Telnet functionality can then be activated. After this, the attacker can access the world-writable (non-restricted) file that controls which programs run on boot, and the attacker may add his own to the list," F-Secure researchers says.¬†

"This allows the attacker persistent access, even if the device is rebooted. In fact, the attack requires the device to be rebooted, but there is a way to force a reboot as well."


No Patch Despite being Alerted Several Months Ago

The security firm said it notified of the vulnerabilities to Foscam several months ago, but received no response. Since the security camera maker has not fixed any of the vulnerabilities to date, F-Secure has not released proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for them.

According to F-Secure, these type of insecure implementation of devices and ignorance of security allowed the Mirai malware to infect hundreds of thousands of vulnerable IoT devices to cause vast internet outage last year by launching massive DDoS attacks against Dyn DNS provider.

In order to protect yourself, you need to be more vigilant about the security of your Internet-of-Thing (IoT) devices because they are dumber than one can ever be.

Researchers advised users who are running one of these devices to strongly consider running the device inside a dedicated local network that's unable to be reached from the outside Internet and isolate from other connected devices.

As a best practice, if you've got any internet-connected device at home or work, change its credentials if it still uses default ones. But changing default passwords won't help you in this case, because Foscam IP cameras are using hard-coded credentials.

	      Petya Ransomware Spreading Rapidly Worldwide, Just Like WannaCry [1.11 Points on average]

Watch out, readers! It is ransomware, another WannaCry, another wide-spread attack.

The WannaCry ransomware is not dead yet and another large scale ransomware attack is making chaos worldwide, shutting down computers at corporates, power supplies, and banks across Russia, Ukraine, Spain, France, UK, India, and Europe and demanding $300 in bitcoins.

According to multiple sources, a new variant of Petya ransomware, also known as Petwrap, is spreading rapidly with the help of same Windows SMBv1 vulnerability that the WannaCry ransomware abused to infect 300,000 systems and servers worldwide in just 72 hours last month.

Apart from this, many victims have also informed that Petya ransomware has also infected their patch systems.


"Petya uses the NSA Eternalblue exploit but also spreads in internal networks with WMIC and PSEXEC. That's why patched systems can get hit." Mikko Hypponen¬†confirms, Chief Research Officer at<span class="highlight-match"> F-Secure.</span>

Petya is a nasty piece of ransomware and works very differently from any other ransomware malware. Unlike other traditional ransomware, Petya does not encrypt files on a targeted system one by one.

Instead, Petya reboots victims computers and encrypts the hard drive's master file table (MFT) and renders the master boot record (MBR) inoperable, restricting access to the full system by seizing information about file names, sizes, and location on the physical disk.

Petya ransomware replaces the computer's MBR with its own malicious code that displays the ransom note and leaves computers unable to boot.


Don't Pay Ransom, You Wouldn‚Äôt Get Your Files Back¬†
Infected users are advised not to pay the ransom because hackers behind Petya ransomware can‚Äôt get your emails anymore.

Posteo, the German email provider, has suspended the email address i.e. wowsmith123456@posteo.net, which was behind used by the criminals to communicate with victims after getting the ransom to send the decryption keys.

At the time of writing, 23 victims have¬†paid¬†in Bitcoin to '1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX' address¬†for decrypting their files infected by Petya, which total roughly $6775.

Petya! Petya! Another Worldwide Ransomware Attack



Screenshots of the latest Petya infection, shared on Twitter, shows that the ransomware displays a text, demanding $300 worth of Bitcoins. Here's what the text read:

"If you see this text, then your files are no longer accessible, because they are encrypted. Perhaps you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don't waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service."
According to a recent VirusTotal scan, currently, only 16 out of 61 anti-virus services are successfully detecting the Petya ransomware malware.


Petya Ransomware Hits Banks, Telecom, Businesses & Power Companies


Supermarket in Kharkiv, East Ukraine

Petya ransomware has already infected ‚Äî¬†Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft, Ukrainian state electricity suppliers, "Kyivenergo" and "Ukrenergo," in past few hours.

"We were attacked. Two hours ago, we had to turn off all our computers. We are waiting for permission from Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) to switch them back on," Kyivenergo's press service said.
There are reports from several banks, including National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and Oschadbank, as well as other companies confirming they have been hit by the Petya ransomware attacks.

Maersk, an international logistics company, has also confirmed on Twitter that the latest Petya ransomware attacks have shut down its IT systems at multiple locations and business units.

"We can confirm that Maersk IT systems are down across multiple sites and business units. We are currently asserting the situation. The safety of our employees, our operations and customers' business is our top priority. We will update when we have more information," the company said.
The ransomware also impacts multiple workstations at Ukrainian branch's mining company Evraz.

The most severe damages reported by Ukrainian businesses also include¬†compromised systems at Ukraine's local metro and Kiev's Boryspil Airport.

Three Ukrainian telecommunication operators, Kyivstar, LifeCell, Ukrtelecom, are also affected in the latest Petya attack.


How Petya Ransomware Spreading So Fast?

Symantec, the cyber security company, has also confirmed that Petya ransomware is exploiting SMBv1 EternalBlue exploit,¬†just like¬†WannaCry, and taking advantage of unpatched Windows machines.

"Petya ransomware successful in spreading because it combines both a client-side attack (CVE-2017-0199) and a network based threat (MS17-010),"¬†security¬†researcher using Twitter handle ‚ÄèHackerFantastic¬†tweeted.

EternalBlue is a Windows SMB exploit leaked by the infamous hacking group Shadow Brokers in its April data dump, who claimed to have stolen it from the US intelligence agency NSA, along with other Windows exploits.

Microsoft has since patched the vulnerability for all versions of Windows operating systems, but many users remain vulnerable, and a string of malware variants are exploiting the flaw to deliver ransomware and mine cryptocurrency.

Just three days ago, we reported about the latest WannaCry attack that hit Honda Motor Company and around 55 speed¬†and traffic light cameras in Japan and Australia, respectively.

Well, it is quite surprising that even after knowing about the WannaCry issue for quite a decent amount of time, big corporates and companies have not yet implemented proper security measures to defend against such threat.


How to Protect Yourself from Ransomware Attacks


What to do immediately? Go and apply those¬†goddamn patches¬†against EternalBlue (MS17-010) and disable the unsecured, 30-year-old¬†SMBv1 file-sharing protocol¬†on your Windows systems and¬†servers.

Since¬†Petya Ransomware is also taking advantage of WMIC and PSEXEC tools to infect fully-patched Windows computers, you are also advised to disable WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line).


Prevent Infection & Petya Kill-Switch
Researcher¬†finds¬†Petya ransomware encrypt systems after rebooting the computer. So if your system is infected with Petya ransomware and it tries to restart, just do not power it back on.

"If machine reboots and you see this message, power off immediately! This is the encryption process. If you do not power on, files are fine." ‚ÄèHackerFantastic¬†tweeted. "Use a LiveCD or external machine to recover files"
PT Security, a UK-based cyber security company and¬†Amit Serper¬†from Cybereason, have discovered a Kill-Switch for Petya ransomware. According to a tweet, company has advised users to create a file i.e. "C:\Windows\perfc" to prevent ransomware infection.

To safeguard against any ransomware infection, you should always be suspicious of unwanted files and documents sent over an email and should never click on links inside them unless verifying the source.

To always have a tight grip on your valuable data, keep a good back-up routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that isn't always connected to your PC.

Moreover, make sure that you run a good and effective anti-virus security suite on your system, and keep it up-to-date. Most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

	      Unpatchable 'DoubleAgent' Attack Can Hijack All Windows Versions ‚Äî Even Your Antivirus! [1.11 Points on average]

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:


Avast (CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)
Avira (CVE-2017-6417)
Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)
Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)
Comodo
ESET<span class="highlight-match">
F-Secure
</span>Kaspersky
Malwarebytes
McAfee
Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

Is anything safe? It's 2017, and the likely answer is NO.

Making sure your passwords are secure is one of the first line of defense ‚Äì for your computer, email, and information ‚Äì against hacking attempts, and Password Managers are the one recommended by many security experts to keep all your passwords secure in one place.

Password Managers are software that creates complex passwords, stores them and organizes all your passwords for your computers, websites, applications and networks, as well as remember them on your behalf.

But what if your Password Managers itself are vulnerable?

Well, it's not just an imagination, as a new report has revealed that some of the most popular password managers are affected by critical vulnerabilities that can expose user credentials.

The report, published on Tuesday by a group of security experts from TeamSIK of the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology in Germany, revealed that nine of the most popular Android password managers available on Google Play are vulnerable to one or more security vulnerabilities.


Popular Android Password Manager Apps Affected By One Or More Flaws

The team examined LastPass, Keeper, 1Password, My Passwords, Dashlane Password Manager, Informaticore's Password Manager,<span class="highlight-match"> F-Secure </span>KEY, Keepsafe, and Avast Passwords ‚Äì each of which has between 100,000 and 50 Million installs.

"The overall results were extremely worrying and revealed that password manager applications, despite their claims, do not provide enough protection mechanisms for the stored passwords and credentials," TeamSIK said.
In each application, the researchers discovered one or more security vulnerabilities ‚Äì a total of 26 issues ‚Äì all of which were reported to the application makers and were fixed before the group's report went public.


Encryption Keys for Master Key Hard-Coded in the App's Code¬†

According to the team, some password manager applications were vulnerable to data residue attacks and clipboard sniffing. Some of the apps stored the master password in plain text or even exposed encryption keys in the code.

For example, one high severity flaw affected Informaticore's Password Manager app, which was due to the app storing the master password in an encrypted form with the encryption key hard coded in the app's code itself. A similar bug was also discovered in LastPass.

In fact, in some cases, the user's stored passwords could have easily been accessed and exfiltrated by any malicious application installed on the user's device.

Besides these issues, the researchers also found that auto-fill functions in most password manager applications could be abused to steal stored secrets through "hidden phishing" attacks.

And what's more worrisome? Any attacker could have easily exploited many of the flaws discovered by the researchers without needing root permissions.


List of Vulnerable Password Managers and Flaws Affecting Them

Here's the list of vulnerabilities disclosed in some of the most popular Android password managers by TeamSIK:

Researcher also going to present their findings at¬†HITB conference¬†next month. For more technical details about each vulnerability, users can head on to the TeamSIK report.

Since the vendors have addressed all these above-listed issues, users are strongly advised to update their password manager apps as soon as possible, because now hackers have all the information they require to exploit vulnerable versions of the password manager apps.

Are your internet-connected devices spying on you? Perhaps.

We already know that the Internet of Thing (IoT) devices are so badly insecure that hackers are adding them to their botnet network for launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against target services.

But, these connected devices are not just limited to conduct DDoS attacks; they have far more potential to harm you.

New research [PDF] published by the content delivery network provider<span class="highlight-match"> Akamai </span>Technologies shows how unknown threat actors are using a 12-year-old vulnerability in OpenSSH to secretly gain control of millions of connected devices.

The hackers then turn, what researchers call, these "Internet of Unpatchable Things" into proxies for malicious traffic to attack internet-based targets and 'internet-facing' services, along with the internal networks that host them.

Unlike recent attacks via Mirai botnet, the new targeted attack, dubbed SSHowDowN Proxy, specifically makes use of IoT devices such as:

Internet-connected Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices.
CCTV, NVR, DVR devices (video surveillance).
Satellite antenna equipment.
Networking devices like routers, hotspots, WiMax, cable and ADSL modems.
Other devices could be susceptible as well.

More importantly, the SSHowDowN Proxy attack exploits over a decade old default configuration flaw (CVE-2004-1653) in OpenSSH that was initially discovered in 2004 and patched in early 2005. The flaw enables TCP forwarding and port bounces when a proxy is in use.

However, after analyzing IP addresses from its Cloud Security Intelligence platform, Akamai estimates that over 2 Million IoT and networking devices have been compromised by SSHowDowN type attacks.

Due to lax credential security, hackers can compromise IoT devices and then use them to mount attacks "against a multitude of Internet targets and Internet-facing services, like HTTP, SMTP and network scanning," and to mount attacks against internal networks that host these connected devices.

Once hackers access the web administration console of vulnerable devices, it is possible for them to compromise the device's data and, in some cases, fully take over the affected machine.

While the flaw itself is not so critical, the company says the continual failure of vendors to secure IoT devices as well as implementing default and hard-coded credentials has made the door wide open for hackers to exploit them.

"We are entering a very interesting time when it comes to DDoS and other web attacks; 'The Internet of Unpatchable Things' so to speak," said Eric Kobrin, senior director of Akamai's Threat Research team.¬†

"New devices are being shipped from the factory not only with this vulnerability exposed but also without any effective way to fix it. We've been hearing for years that it was theoretically possible for IoT devices to attack. That, unfortunately, has now become the reality."
According to the company, at least 11 of Akamai's customers in industries such as financial services, retail, hospitality, and gaming have been targets of SSHowDowN Proxy attack.

The company is "currently working with the most prevalent device vendors on a proposed plan of mitigation."

 

How to Mitigate Such Attacks?

So, if you own a connected coffee machine, thermostat or any IoT device, you can protect yourself by changing the factory default credentials of your device as soon as you activate it, as well as disabling SSH services on the device if it is not required.

More technical users can establish inbound firewall rules that prevent SSH access to and from external forces.

Meanwhile, vendors of internet-connected devices are recommended to:

Avoid shipping such products with undocumented accounts.
Force their customers to change the factory default credentials after device installation.
Restrict TCP forwarding.
Allow users to update the SSH configuration to mitigate such flaws.

Since IoT devices number has now reached in the tens of billions, it‚Äôs time to protect these devices before hackers cause a disastrous situation.

Non-profit organizations like MITRE has come forward to help protect IoT devices by challenging researchers to come up with new, non-traditional approaches for detecting rogue IoT devices on a network. The company is also offering up to $50,000 prize money.

The group of unknown hackers who hijacked CCleaner's download server to distribute a malicious version of the popular system optimization software targeted at least 20 major international technology companies with a second-stage payload.

Earlier this week, when the CCleaner hack was reported, researchers assured users that there's no second stage malware used in the massive attack and affected users can simply update their version in order to get rid of the malicious software.

However, during the analysis of the hackers' command-and-control (C2) server to which the malicious CCleaner versions connected, security researchers from Cisco's Talos Group found evidence of a second payload (GeeSetup_x86.dll, a lightweight backdoor module) that was delivered to a specific list of computers based on local domain names.


Affected Technology Firms¬†

According to a predefined list mentioned in the configuration of the C2 server, the attack was designed to find computers inside the networks of the major technology firms and deliver the secondary payload. The target companies included:

Google
Microsoft
Cisco
Intel
Samsung
Sony
HTC
Linksys
D-Link<span class="highlight-match">
Akamai
</span>VMware

In the database, researchers found a list of nearly 700,000 backdoored machines infected with the malicious version of CCleaner, i.e. the first-stage payload, and a list of at least 20 machines that were infected with the secondary payload to get a deeper foothold on those systems.

The CCleaner hackers specifically chose these 20 machines based upon their Domain name, IP address, and Hostname. The researchers believe the secondary malware was likely intended for industrial espionage.


CCleaner Malware Links to Chinese Hacking Group

According to the researchers from Kaspersky, the CCleaner malware shares some code with the hacking tools used by a sophisticated Chinese hacking group called Axiom, also known as APT17, Group 72, DeputyDog, Tailgater Team, Hidden Lynx or AuroraPanda.

"The malware injected into #CCleaner has shared code with several tools used by one of the APT groups from the #Axiom APT 'umbrella'," tweeted director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab.
Cisco researchers also note that one configuration file on the attacker's server was set for China's time zone, which suggests China could be the source of the CCleaner attack. However, this evidence alone is not enough for attribution.

Cisco Talos researchers also said that they have already notified the affected tech companies about a possible breach.


Removing Malicious CCleaner Version would Not Help

Just removing the Avast's software application from the infected machines would not be enough to get rid of the CCleaner second stage malware payload from their network, with the attackers' still-active C2 server.

So, affected companies that have had their computers infected with the malicious version of CCleaner are strongly recommended to fully restore their systems from backup versions before the installation of the tainted security program.

"These findings also support and reinforce our previous recommendation that those impacted by this supply chain attack should not simply remove the affected version of CCleaner or update to the latest version, but should restore from backups or reimage systems to ensure that they completely remove not only the backdoored version of CCleaner but also any other malware that may be resident on the system," the researchers say.
For those who are unaware, the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware, and affected users should update the software to version 5.34 or higher.

On Thursday, we compiled a story based on research published by a British security expert reporting that some cyber criminals are apparently using Mirai Botnet to conduct DDoS attacks against the telecommunication companies in Liberia, a small African country.

In his blog post, Kevin Beaumont claimed that a Liberian transit provider confirmed him about the DDoS attack of more than 500 Gbps targeting one undersea cable servicing Internet connectivity for the entire country.

Later, some media outlets also confirmed that the DDoS attack caused Internet outage in some parts of the country, citing ‚Äòslow Internet‚Äô and ‚Äòtotal outage‚Äô experienced by some local sources and citizens.

"The DDoS is killing our business. We have a challenge with the DDoS. We are hoping someone can stop it. It's killing our revenue. Our business has frequently been targeted" an employee with one Liberian mobile service provider told PC World.
Network firm Level 3 confirmed Zack Whittaker of ZDNet that it had seen attacks on telecoms companies in Liberia making access to the web spotty. Other reports suggested mobile net access was affected too.

"At first I thought it was a problem with my internet provider, which often suffers from slow speeds. But this feels more serious. Even when you do get online, the connection repeatedly cuts out." BBC Africa's Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Liberia shared his experience.
Of course, based on the high concern, the story went viral and Kevin's research was covered by other media outlets, including BBC, PC World, The Guardian, Forbes, IBtimes, Quartz, Mashable, although few of them interpreted the incident incorrectly and claimed that the attack took down the entire country's Internet.

In our article, we explicitly mentioned multiple times that criminals are "using Mirai Botnet to shut down the Internet for an entire country" and "trying to take down the Internet of Liberia."

The only mistake in our previous article was the image caption which briefly said, "DDoS takes down entire country offline." We apologize to our readers for an incorrect image caption, which has now been corrected.


Latest Insights On Liberia DDoS Attack Story

After Kevin‚Äôs story, some new developments with more insights have appeared.

Doug Madory, the Director of Internet Analysis at Dyn Research¬†tweeted that DYN and Internet-infrastructure company<span class="highlight-match"> Akamai </span>have no data that supports any nationwide Internet outage in Liberia.

The Hacker News has also been contacted by Kpetermeni Siakor, who manages infrastructure at the Liberia Internet Exchange Point, stating that only Lonestarcell MTN, one of the country's four major telecommunication companies, faced 500 Gbps of DDoS attack for a short period, which was mitigated successfully.

"From inspecting our logs at the Liberia IXP, we didn't see any downtime in the past three weeks. The general manager of the CCL also couldn't confirm any issues with the ACE cable," Siakor said.
In our previous article, the primary concern surrounds around two facts: The Mirai Botnet capability and ACE submarine fiber-optic cable capacity.

Where just 100,000 Mirai bots were successful in knocking down the majority of Internet Offline two weeks ago, how easy it could be for millions of bots to DDoS the ACE submarine fiber-optic cable, whose total capacity is just 5.12 Tbps that is being shared between all of the 23 countries, including Liberia.

So, when we said that someone was trying to take the entire country down, we meant that cyber criminals have such capacity to do so, and since they have targeted one network operator, does not mean they would not attack other network operators that could impact the Internet services in the country.


Mirai Malware Threat: Protect Your IoT Devices

The incidents involving the Mirai malware is extremely worrying because it can take over insecure cameras, DVRs, and routers, which are widely available all around the world ‚Äì Thanks to lazy manufacturers and customers.

Mirai malware scans for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are still using their default passwords and then enslaves those devices into a botnet, which is then used to launch DDoS attacks.

So, the best way to protect yourself and your devices is to be more vigilant about the security of your smart devices.

In our previous article, we provided some basic, rather practical, solutions that will help you protect your IoT devices from becoming part of the Mirai botnet. You can also check also yourself if your IoT device is vulnerable to Mirai malware.

Do you believe that just because you have downloaded an app from the official app store, you're safe from malware?

Think twice before believing it.

A team of security researchers from several security firms have uncovered a new, widespread botnet that consists of tens of thousands of hacked Android smartphones.

Dubbed WireX, detected as "Android Clicker," the botnet network primarily includes infected Android devices running one of the hundreds of malicious apps installed from Google Play Store and is designed to conduct massive application layer DDoS attacks.

Researchers from different Internet technology and security companies‚Äîwhich includes<span class="highlight-match"> Akamai,</span> CloudFlare, Flashpoint, Google, Oracle Dyn, RiskIQ, Team Cymru‚Äîspotted a series of cyber attacks earlier this month, and they collaborated to combat it.

Although Android malware campaigns are quite common these days and this newly discovered campaign is also not that much sophisticated, I am quite impressed with the way multiple security firms‚Äîwhere half of them are competitors‚Äîcame together and shared information to take down a botnet.


WireX botnet was used to launch minor DDoS attacks earlier this month, but after mid-August, the attacks began to escalate.

The "WireX" botnet had already infected over 120,000 Android smartphones at its peak earlier this month, and on 17th August, researchers noticed a massive DDoS attack (primarily HTTP GET requests) originated from more than 70,000 infected mobile devices from over 100 countries.

If your website has been DDoSed, look for the following pattern of User-Agent strings to check if it was WireX botnet: 


After further investigation, security researchers identified more than 300 malicious apps on Google‚Äôs official Play Store, many of which purported to be media, video players, ringtones, or tools for storage managers and app stores, which include the malicious WireX code.

Just like many malicious apps, WireX apps do not act maliciously immediately after the installation in order to evade detection and make their ways to Google Play Store.

Instead, WireX apps wait patiently for commands from its command and control servers located at multiple subdomains of "axclick.store."

Google has identified and already blocked most of 300 WireX apps, which were mostly downloaded by users in Russia, China, and other Asian countries, although the WireX botnet is still active on a small scale.


If your device is running a newer version of the Android operating system that includes Google's Play Protect feature, the company will automatically remove WireX apps from your device, if you have one installed.

Play Protect is Google's newly launched security feature that uses machine learning and app usage analysis to remove (uninstall) malicious apps from users Android smartphones to prevent further harm.

Also, it is highly recommended to install apps from reputed and verified developers, even when downloading from Google official Play Store and avoid installing unnecessary apps.

Additionally, you are strongly advised to always keep a good antivirus app on your mobile device that can detect and block malicious apps before they can infect your device, and always keep your device and apps up-to-date.

Android malware continues to evolve with more sophisticated and never-seen-before attack vectors and capabilities with every passing day.

Just at the beginning of this week, Google removed over 500 Android apps utilising the rogue SDK‚Äîthat secretly distribute spyware to users‚Äîfrom its Play Store marketplace.

Last month, we also saw first Android malware with code injecting capabilities making rounds on Google Play Store.

A few days after that, researchers discovered another malicious Android SDK ads library, dubbed "Xavier," found installed on more than 800 different apps that had been downloaded millions of times from Google Play Store.

So far, nobody had an idea that who was behind WannaCry ransomware attacks?

But now there is a clue that lies in the code.

Neel Mehta, a security researcher at Google, found evidence that suggests the WannaCry ransomware, that infected 300,000 machines in 150 countries over the weekend, is linked to a state-sponsored hacking group in North Korea, known for cyber attacks against South Korean organizations.


What's Happening? What is WannaCry?
This is the fifth day since the WannaCry ransomware attack surfaced, that leverages a critical Windows SMB exploit and still infecting machines across the world using newly released variants that don't have any "kill switch" ability.

In case, if you have landed on WannaCry story for the first time, and don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, you are advised to also read this simple, summarized, but detailed explanation:

WannaCry: What Has Happened So Far & How to protect your PCs


WannaCry: First Nation-State Powered Ransomware?


Neel discovered that the code found in the WannaCry malware‚Äîone that first surfaced in February‚Äîwas identical to the code used in an early 2015 version of Cantopee, a malicious backdoor developed by Lazarus Group, believed to be a state-sponsored hacking group linked to the North Korean government.

Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab, Intezer, Symantec, and<span class="highlight-match"> Comae </span>Technologies immediately followed the tip from Neel and confirmed a strong link between WannaCry and other malware families, including Lazarus, Joanap, and Brambul, which suggests WannaCry was written or modified by the same author.


Operating since at least 2011, Lazarus Group of hackers believed to be responsible for the 2013 DarkSeoul operation, the devastating 2014 Sony Pictures Hack, and the 2016 Bangladesh $81 Million bank heist.

However, this finding is not yet sufficient to link the Lazarus Group to WannaCry, because it is possible that WannaCry authors may have purposely copied code from Lazarus' backdoor program in an attempt to mislead researchers and law enforcement as they investigate.

"We believe that there are sufficient connections to warrant further investigation. We will continue to share further details of our research as it unfolds," says Symantec, the security firm which has tracked the Lazarus over recent years.

Agreeing to the same, Matt Suiche from Comaeio said:


"The attribution to Lazarus Group would make sense regarding their narrative which in the past was dominated by infiltrating financial institutions in the goal of stealing money. If validated, this means the latest iteration of WannaCry would, in fact, be the first nation state powered ransomware."


Is the WannaCry Attack Over? *NO*

Absolutely Not; this is just the beginning.

Security researchers have discovered some new variants of this ransomware, which could not be stopped by the kill switch, so you are advised to make sure you have applied the patch for SMB vulnerability and disabled SMBv1 protocol to keep your Windows computers safe from WannaCry and other similar attacks.

The WannaCry attackers demand ransom fees between $300 to $600 to free the hijacked data. The three bitcoin wallets tied to #WannaCry ransomware have received 225 payments totaling 35.98003282 BTC (approx. $60,000) from ransomware victims.

If your PC has been infected by WannaCry ‚Äì the ransomware that wreaked havoc across the world last Friday ‚Äì you might be lucky to get your locked files back without paying the ransom of $300 to the cyber criminals.

Adrien Guinet, a French security researcher from Quarkslab, has discovered a way to retrieve the secret encryption keys used by the WannaCry ransomware for free, which works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and 2008 operating systems.


WannaCry Ransomware Decryption Keys

The WannaCry's encryption scheme works by generating a pair of keys on the victim's computer that rely on prime numbers, a "public" key and a "private" key for encrypting and decrypting the system‚Äôs files respectively.

To prevent the victim from accessing the private key and decrypting locked files himself, WannaCry erases the key from the system, leaving no choice for the victims to retrieve the decryption key except paying the ransom to the attacker.

But here's the kicker: WannaCry "does not erase the prime numbers from memory before freeing the associated memory," says Guinet.

Based on this finding, Guinet released a WannaCry ransomware decryption tool, named WannaKey, that basically tries to retrieve the two prime numbers, used in the formula to generate encryption keys from memory, and works on Windows XP only.

Note: Below I have also mentioned another tool, dubbed WanaKiwi, that works for Windows XP to Windows 7.

"It does so by searching for them in the wcry.exe process. This is the process that generates the RSA private key. The main issue is that the CryptDestroyKey and CryptReleaseContext does not erase the prime numbers from memory before freeing the associated memory." says Guinet

So, that means, this method will work only if:

The affected computer has not been rebooted after being infected.
The associated memory has not been allocated and erased by some other process.

"In order to work, your computer must not have been rebooted after being infected. Please also note that you need some luck for this to work (see below), and so it might not work in every case!," Guinet says.

"This is not really a mistake from the ransomware authors, as they properly use the Windows Crypto API."

While WannaKey only pulls prime numbers from the memory of the affected computer, the tool can only be used by those who can use those prime numbers to generate the decryption key manually to decrypt their WannaCry-infected PC‚Äôs files.


WanaKiwi: WannaCry Ransomware Decryption Tool


Good news is that another security researcher, Benjamin Delpy, developed an easy-to-use tool called "WanaKiwi," based on Guinet's finding, which simplifies the whole process of the WannaCry-infected file decryption.

All victims have to do is download WanaKiwi tool from Github and run it on their affected Windows computer using the command line (cmd).

WanaKiwi works on Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and 2008, confirmed Matt Suiche from security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Comae </span>Technologies, who has also provided some demonstrations showing how to use WanaKiwi to decrypt your files.

Although the tool won't work for every user due to its dependencies, still it gives some hope to WannaCry's victims of getting their locked files back for free even from Windows XP, the aging, largely unsupported version of Microsoft's operating system.

It seems like the NSA has been HACKED!

Update: The NSA Hack ‚Äî What, When, Where, How, Who & Why? Explained Here.

An unknown hacker or a group of hackers just claimed to have hacked into "Equation Group" -- a cyber-attack group allegedly associated with the United States intelligence organization NSA -- and dumped a bunch of its hacking tools (malware, private exploits, and hacking tools) online.

I know, it is really hard to believe, but some cybersecurity experts who have been examining the leak data, exploits and hacking tools, believe it to be legitimate.

Hacker Demands $568 Million in Bitcoin to Leak All Tools and Data

Not just this, the hackers, calling themselves "The Shadow Brokers," are also asking for 1 Million Bitcoins (around $568 Million) in an auction to release the 'best' cyber weapons and more files.

Widely believed to be part of the NSA, Equation Group was described as "a threat actor that surpasses anything known in terms of complexity and sophistication of techniques, and that has been active for almost two decades," according to a report published by security firm Kaspersky in 2015.

Equation Group was also linked to the previous infamous Regin and Stuxnet attacks, allegedly the United States sponsored hacks, though the link was never absolutely proven.

Two days back, The Shadow Brokers released some files, which it claimed came from the Equation Group, on Github¬†(deleted) and Tumblr.


Exploits for American & Chinese Firewalls Leaked:

The files mostly contained installation scripts, configurations for command-and-control (C&C) servers, and exploits allegedly designed to target routers and firewalls from American manufacturers including, Cisco, Juniper, and Fortinet.

According to the leaked files, Chinese company 'Topsec' was also an Equation Group target.

The leak mentioned names of some of the hacking tools that correlate with names used in the documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, like "BANANAGLEE" and "EPICBANANA."

"We follow Equation Group traffic," says the Shadow Broker. "We find Equation Group source range. We hack Equation Group. We find many many Equation Group cyber weapons. You see pictures. We give you some Equation Group files free, you see. This is good proof no? You enjoy!!! You break many things. You find many intrusions. You write many words. But not all, we are auction the best files."
It is yet not confirmed whether the leaked documents are legitimate or not, but some security experts agree that it likely is.

"I haven't tested the exploits, but they definitely look like legitimate exploits," Matt Suiche, founder of UAE-based cyber security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Comae </span>Technologies, told the Daily Dot.

While some are saying that the leak could be a very well-researched hoax, and the Bitcoin auction could be nothing but a distraction in an attempt to gain media attention.

"If this is a hoax, the perpetrators put a huge amount of effort in," security researcher The Grugq told Motherboard. "The proof files look pretty legit, and they are exactly the sorts of exploits you would expect a group that targets communications infrastructure to deploy and use."
However, if NSA has successfully been hacked, the hack would be a highly critical cyber security incident.

	      Turns Out New Petya is Not a Ransomware, It‚Äôs a Destructive Wiper Malware [0.98 Points on average]

What if I say the Tuesday's devastating global malware outbreak was not due to any ransomware infection?

Yes, the Petya ransomware attacks that began infecting computers in several countries, including Russia, Ukraine, France, India and the United States on Tuesday and demands $300 ransom was not designed with the intention of restoring the computers at all.

According to a new analysis, the virus was designed to look like ransomware but was wiper malware that wipes computers outright, destroying all records from the targeted systems.
<span class="highlight-match">
Comae </span>Technologies Founder Matt Suiche, who closely looked the operation of the malware, said after analyzing the virus, known as Petya, his team found that it was a "Wiper malware," not ransomware.

Security experts even believe the real attack has been disguised to divert world's attention from a state-sponsored attack on Ukraine to a malware outbreak.


"We believe the ransomware was, in fact, a lure to control the media narrative, especially after the WannaCry incident, to attract the attention on some mysterious hacker group rather than a national state attacker," Suiche writes.


Is Petya Ransomware Faulty or Over-Smart?

Petya is a nasty piece of malware that, unlike other traditional ransomware, does not encrypt files on a targeted system one by one. 

Instead, Petya reboots victims computers and encrypts the hard drive's master file table (MFT) and renders the master boot record (MBR) inoperable, restricting access to the full system by seizing information about file names, sizes, and location on the physical disk.

Then Petya ransomware takes an encrypted copy of MBR and replaces it with its own malicious code that displays a ransom note, leaving computers unable to boot.


However, this new variant of Petya does not keep a copy of replaced MBR, mistakenly or purposely, leaving infected computers unbootable even if victims get the decryption keys. 

Also, after infecting one machine, the Petya ransomware scans the local network and quickly infects all other machines (even fully-patched) on the same network, using EternalBlue SMB exploit, WMIC and PSEXEC tools.


Don't Pay Ransom; You Wouldn‚Äôt Get Your Files Back

So far, nearly 45 victims have already paid total $10,500 in Bitcoins in hope to get their locked files back, but unfortunately, they would not.

It's because the email address, which was being set-up by the attackers to communicate with victims and send decryption keys, was suspended by the German provider shortly after the outbreak.

Meaning, even if victims do pay the ransom, they will never recover their files. Kaspersky researchers also said same.


"Our analysis indicates there is little hope for victims to recover their data. We have analyzed the high-level code of the encryption routine, and we have figured out that after disk encryption, the threat actor could not decrypt victims‚Äô disks," the security firm said.


"To decrypt a victim‚Äôs disk threat actors need the installation ID. In previous versions of 'similar' ransomware like Petya/Mischa/GoldenEye this installation ID contained the information necessary for key recovery."

If claims made by the researcher is correct that the new variant of Petya is a destructive malware designed to shut down and disrupt services around the world, the malware has successfully done its job.

However, it is still speculation, but the virus primarily and massively targeted multiple entities in Ukraine, including the country's local metro, Kiev's Boryspil airport, electricity supplier, the central bank, and the state telecom.

Other countries infected by the Petya virus included Russia, France, Spain, India, China, the United States, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Turkey and South Korea.


How Did Petya get into the Computers in the First Place?

According to research conducted by Talos Intelligence, little-known Ukrainian firm MeDoc is likely the primary source of the yesterday's global ransomware outbreak.

Researchers said the virus has possibly been spread through a malicious software update to a Ukrainian tax accounting system called MeDoc, though MeDoc has denied the allegations in a lengthy Facebook post.


"At the time of updating the program, the system could not be infected with the virus directly from the update file," translated version of MeDoc post reads. "We can argue that users of the MEDoc system can not infect their PC with viruses at the time of updating the program."

However, several security researchers and even Microsoft agreed with Talo's finding, saying MeDoc was breached and the virus was spread via updates.

How many Internet-connected devices do you have in your home? I am surrounded by around 25 such devices.

It's not just your PC, smartphone, and tablet that are connected to the Internet. Today our homes are filled with tiny computers embedded in everything from security cameras, TVs and refrigerators to thermostat and door locks.

However, when it comes to security, people generally ignore to protect all these connected devices and focus on securing their PCs and smartphones with a good antivirus software or a firewall application.

What if any of these connected devices, that are poorly configured or insecure by design, get hacked?

It would give hackers unauthorized access to your whole network allowing them to compromise other devices connected to the same network, spy on your activities and steal sensitive information by using various sophisticated hacks.

There have already been numerous cases of attackers hacking home appliances, industrial control, automotive, medical equipment, utility systems ‚Äî thanks to the insecure Internet of Things (IoT).

IoT threats have risen enormously in past few months, especially DDoS-based botnets and ransomware attacks, which have shaken the digital world.


Can You Protect Your Entire Home Network?


While IoT manufacturers and Internet standard creators have a huge role to play in securing these vulnerable devices, consumers must also take some personal responsibility in protecting their own devices.

There are numerous security articles available on the Internet providing useful recommendations for securing your smart devices.

But when it comes to manually protecting all IoT security issues, it is not possible for all users, especially non-techies, to understand and fix them in with no time or effort. Moreover, it is also annoying to regular check and update every single device.

So, there's a sure shot solution to all your issues ‚Äî<span class="highlight-match"> Bitdefender </span>BOX.


One Device to Secure Your Entire Home Network and Connected Devices

The new Bitdefender BOX is a tiny hardware-based security solution which is being designed in a way that includes network firewall, intrusion prevention system, vulnerability scanner and an antivirus solution.

Setting up the Bitdefender BOX is quite easy. This tiny box can be connected to your existing internet router to monitor all the Internet traffic and connected devices in real-time, preventing unauthorized access to your home network.


1. Network and Wi-Fi Security


Once connected, Bitdefender BOX automatically scans your network and makes a list of everything that is connected to it in order to protect and monitor things.

To identify known malicious patterns designed to disrupt or spy on you, Bitdefender BOX continually intercepts and scans for only essential parts of the data packets that flow in and out of your network.

One of the major benefits of Bitdefender BOX is that it automatically keeps an eye on every device that joins your network, whether it be you, a guest, or hacker.

When a new device logs into your network, Bitdefender BOX automatically alerts you with a pop-up on your phone, allowing you to quickly kick malicious users off your network with just a single tap.


2. Bitdefender BOX Deploys Award-winning Antivirus Software for all of your Devices

Bitdefender BOX also provides antivirus protection via Bitdefender's cloud-based threat intelligence network for every device on your network, alerting you to every attempted intrusion or malware that comes from the Internet.

Bitdefender's Total Security Multi-Device (TSMD) is a complete cyber security solution that protects your standard devices ‚Äì laptops, desktops, smartphones and tablets ‚Äì across Windows, Mac OS, and Android platforms. Bitdefender BOX comes with a one-year subscription to TSMD, as well as the freedom to deploy it to an unlimited number of devices. That means you can protect every classic device in your network ‚Äì all with this powerful, award-winning software.

However, what if you are not at home within the range of your home network?

Don't worry about it, because Bitdefender BOX will secure your device remotely outside of the range using a VPN (virtual private network) connection between the agent and BOX, routing all your traffic and analyzing it for any threat.

Bitdefender BOX also protects all your connected devices from man-in-the-middle (MITM) and other cyber-attacks when you connect to insecure networks, such as public Wi-Fi hotspots.

Bitdefender BOX also has Ransomware protection built in, protecting your network from ransomware attacks. Ransomware is a nasty program that locks your files and asks you ransom to be paid in Bitcoins, which is the only way to get back your files.


3. Built-in Vulnerability Assessment Tool

Bitdefender BOX also comes with a vulnerability scanner that scans every device on your home network to find any weak spots that can compromise the integrity of the network.

Bitdefender BOX checks for your password strength, firmware version and any vulnerability that can be used as a backdoor to gain remote access or unauthorized access to your connected devices or network equipment, steal your data or launch attacks.

If you want to review the status of your connected devices and address detected issues, just click the Vulnerable Devices button in the BOX app and keep your network safe.


4. Behavior-based Threat Detection

Want more? The BOX can also smell a rat.

Yes, this little gadget also notices the suspicious behavior of any device on your network and protects other devices on the same network from unauthorized access and tampering.

Most behavioral security solutions are usually designed for large, highly distributed networks run by large organizations and government agencies, but Bitdefender BOX brings the same level of security for your home network.

Bitdefender Active Threat Control has been designed to detect never-before-seen threats and classify advanced malware, including variants of known and unknown threat families, in real-time using machine learning and behavior-based threat analysis and improves security and privacy of your connected devices.


Bitdefender BOX ‚Äì Should You Buy It?

With these impressive features, Bitdefender BOX is a win-win product for your smart home network, which guards and protects your home environment from every single threat, whether it's a hacker, malware, an intruder or a guest.

The BOX supports all devices running iOS 9 and later, Android 4.1 and later and Windows 7 (SP1) and later (32 and 64 bit).

Usually, Bitdefender BOX comes at $199, but the company is currently offering a $70 discount. So, you can buy it at $129.

Bitdefender BOX is well worth every single penny for those who want security protection for all of their devices, including smart home gadgets, plus antivirus for PCs, Mac and Android.


Other Quick Ways (Manual) to Protect your IoT Devices

Meanwhile, there are some typical manual ways that you should consider to protect your smart device from being hacked. You can follow these simple steps:

1. Change Default Passwords: If you have got any internet-connected device at home or work, change your credentials if it still uses default ones. Changing those passwords periodically is also not a bad idea.

2. Disable Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP): UPnP comes enabled by default on every internet-connected device, creating a hole in your router's security that could allow malware to infiltrate any part of your local network. So, check for "Universal Plug and Play" features and turn them OFF.

3. Disable Remote Management through Telnet: Go into your router's settings and disable Remote Management Protocol, specifically through Telnet, because this protocol is used for allowing one computer to control another from a remote location. It has also been used in previous Mirai attacks.

4. Check for Software Updates and Patches: Last but not the least, always keep your internet-connected devices and routers up-to-date with the latest vendor firmware.

Don't forget that it is every single customer's job in the entire IoT devices chain to be responsible for the security of their point of connection as well as beyond.

Moreover, when it comes to small-area or city-wide IoT implementations, anything connected to the Internet must be secured before bringing onto the network.

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:


Avast (CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)
Avira (CVE-2017-6417)<span class="highlight-match">
Bitdefender </span>(CVE-2017-6186)
Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)
Comodo
ESET
F-Secure
Kaspersky
Malwarebytes
McAfee
Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

Security researchers have discovered a new Mac malware allegedly developed by APT28 Russian cyber espionage group who is believed to be responsible for 2016 presidential election hacking scandal.

A new variant of the X-Agent spyware is now targeting Apple macOS system that has previously been used in cyber attacks against Windows, iOS, Android, and Linux devices.

The malware is designed to steal web browser passwords, take screenshots of the display, detect system configurations, execute files and exfiltrate iPhone backups stored on the computer.

The X-Agent malware is tied to Russian hacking group known as APT28 ‚Äî also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Sednit, and Pawn Storm ‚Äî that has been operating since at least 2007 and is allegedly linked to the Russian government.

"Our past analysis of samples known to be linked to APT28 group shows a number of similarities between the Sofacy/APT28/Sednit Xagent component for Windows/Linux and the Mac OS binary that currently forms the object of our investigation,"<span class="highlight-match"> Bitdefender </span>reported in a blog post published Tuesday.¬†

"For once, there is the presence of similar modules, such as FileSystem, KeyLogger, and RemoteShell, as well as a similar network module called HttpChanel."
Like variants for other platforms, the Mac version of X-Agent spyware is also act as a backdoor with advanced cyber-espionage capabilities that can be customized depending on the objectives of an attack.


Moreover, X-Agent is being planted by exploiting a vulnerability in the MacKeeper software installed on the targeted computers and known malware dropper Komplex ‚Äî a first-stage trojan that APT28 uses to infect machines.

Abovementioned evidence indicates that the newly discovered Mac version of X-Agent is also created by the same Russian hacking group.

Once successfully installed, the backdoor checks for the presence of a debugger and if it finds one, it terminates itself to prevent execution. But if not, the backdoor waits for an Internet connection to communicate with the command-and-control servers.

"After the communication has been established, the payload starts the modules. Our preliminary analysis shows most of the C&C URLs impersonate Apple domains," Bitdefender researchers said.¬†

"Once connected to the C&C, the payload sends a HelloMessage, then spawns two communication threads running in infinite loops. The former uses POST requests to send information to the C&C, while the latter monitors GET requests for commands."
The Research is still ongoing and Bitdefender security researchers right now only have the Mac malware sample and not a full picture of how an attack works.

APT28 is one of the two Russian-linked cyber-espionage groups that have been accused of hacking into the U.S. Democratic National Committee's email server last year and interfering with the 2016 presidential election.

After targeting Windows-based computers over the past few years, hackers are now shifting their interest to Macs as well.

The emergence of the first macro-based Word document attack against Apple's macOS platform is the latest example to prove this.

The concept of Macros dates back to 1990s. You might be familiar with the message that reads: "Warning: This document contains macros."

Macro is a series of commands and actions that help automate some tasks. Microsoft Office programs support Macros written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), but they can also be used for malicious activities like installing malware.

Until now, hackers were cleverly using this technique to target Windows.

However, security researchers have now detected the first in-the-wild instance of hackers are making use of malicious macros in Word documents to install malware on Mac computers and steal your data ‚Äì an old Windows technique.

The hack tricks victims into opening infected Word documents that subsequently run malicious macros. One such malicious Word file discovered by the researcher was titled "U.S. Allies and Rivals Digest Trump's Victory ‚Äì Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.docm."

However, after clicking on the malicious Word document and before running it on your system, Mac users are always prompted to enable macros.

Denying permission can save you, but if enabled ignoring warnings, the embedded macro executes a function, coded in Python, that downloads the malware payload to infect the Mac PCs, allowing hackers to monitor webcams, access browser history logs, and steal password and encryption keys.

According to a blog post published this week by Patrick Wardle, director of research at security firm Synack, the Python function is virtually identical to EmPyre ‚Äì an open source Mac and Linux post-exploitation agent.
"It‚Äôs kind of a low-tech solution, but on one hand it‚Äôs abusing legitimate functionality so it‚Äôs not going to crash like a memory corruption or overflow might, and it‚Äôs not going to be patched out," said Wardle.Wardle tracked the IP address from which the malicious Word documents were spread to Russia and that IP has previously been associated with malicious activities like phishing attacks.

Another malicious attack discovered by researchers this week also relied on standard Windows techniques by prompting users to download and install a fake software update, but actually harvest the user Keychain, phish usernames and passwords, and other sensitive data.

The MacDownloader nasty virus presented itself as both an update for Adobe Flash and the<span class="highlight-match"> Bitdefender </span>Adware Removal Tool, which are always annoying and dismissed by most users.

This is what all attackers want. Once the user clicks on either reject the updates or just press yes to dismiss it once and for all, the malware gets the green signal to harvest user keychain, phish usernames and passwords, collect private and sensitive data, and then send them back to attackers.

Researchers have spotted macOS malware targeting mostly the defense industry and reported to have been used against a human rights advocate.

The best way to avoid these kinds of attacks is to just deny permission to enable macros from running when opening a suspicious Word document and avoid downloading software from third-party App Store or untrusted websites.

WikiLeaks has just published a new set of classified documents linked to another CIA project, dubbed 'Imperial,' which reveals details of at least three CIA-developed hacking tools and implants designed to target computers running Apple Mac OS X and different flavours of Linux operating systems.

If you are a regular reader of THN, you must be aware that this latest revelation by the whistleblower organisation is the part of an ongoing CIA-Vault 7 leaks, marking it as the 18th batch in the series.

If you are unaware of the Vault 7 leaks, you can head on to the second of this article for having a brief look on all the leaks at once.

Achilles ‚Äî Tool to Backdoor Mac OS X Disk Images
Dubbed Achilles, the hacking tool allows CIA operators to combine malicious Trojan applications with a legitimate Mac OS app into a disk image installer (.DMG) file.

The binding tool, the shell script is written in Bash, gives the CIA operators "one or more desired operator specified executables" for a one-time execution.

As soon as an unsuspecting user downloads an infected disk image on his/her Apple computer, opens and installs the software, the malicious executables would also run in the background.

Afterwards, all the traces of the Achilles tool would be "removed securely" from the downloaded application so that the file would "exactly resemble" the original legitimate app, un-trojaned application, making it hard for the investigators and antivirus software to detect the initial infection vector.

Achilles v1.0, developed in 2011, was only tested on Mac OS X 10.6, which is Apple's Snow Leopard operating system that the company launched in 2009.

SeaPea ‚Äî Stealthy Rootkit For Mac OS X Systems
The second hacking tool, called SeaPea, is a Mac OS X Rootkit that gives CIA operators stealth and tool launching capabilities by hiding important files, processes and socket connections from the users, allowing them to access Macs without victims knowledge.

Developed in 2011, the Mac OS X Rootkit works on computers running then-latest Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) Operating System (32- or 64-bit Kernel Compatible) and Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) Operating System.

The rootkit requires root access to be installed on a target Mac computer and cannot be removed unless the startup disk is reformatted or the infected Mac is upgraded to the next version of the operating system.

Aeris ‚Äî An Automated Implant For Linux Systems
The third CIA hacking tool, dubbed Aeris, is an automated implant written in C programming language that is specifically designed to backdoor portable Linux-based Operating Systems, including Debian, CentOS, Red Hat ‚Äî along with FreeBSD and Solaris.

Aeris is a builder that CIA operators can use to generate customised impacts, depending upon their covert operation.
"It supports automated file exfiltration, configurable beacon interval and jitter, stand-alone and Collide-based HTTPS LP support and SMTP protocol support ‚Äî all with TLS encrypted communications with mutual authentication,"¬†"It's compatible with the NOD Cryptographic Specification and provides structured command and control that's similar to that used by several Windows implants."
Previous Vault 7 CIA Leaks
Last week, WikiLeaks revealed about CIA contractor<span class="highlight-match"> Raytheon </span>Blackbird Technologies, which analysed in-the-wild advanced malware and hacking techniques and submitted at least five reports to the agency for help develop their own malware.

Since March, the whistle-blowing group has published 18 batches of "Vault 7" series, which includes the latest and last week leaks, along with the following batches:

Highrise Project ‚Äî the alleged CIA project that allowed the spying agency to stealthy collect and forwarded stolen data from compromised smartphones to its server through SMS messages.
BothanSpy and Gyrfalcon ‚Äî two alleged CIA implants that allowed the spying agency to intercept and exfiltrate SSH credentials from targeted Windows and Linux operating systems using different attack vectors.
OutlawCountry ‚Äì An alleged CIA project that allowed it to hack and remotely spy on computers running the Linux operating systems.
ELSA ‚Äì the alleged CIA malware that tracks geo-location of targeted PCs and laptops running the Microsoft Windows operating system.
Brutal Kangaroo ‚Äì A tool suite for Microsoft Windows used by the agency to targets closed networks or air-gapped computers within an organization or enterprise without requiring any direct access.
Cherry Blossom ‚Äì An agency's framework, basically a remotely controllable firmware-based implant, used for monitoring the Internet activity of the targeted systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi devices.
Pandemic ‚Äì A CIA's project that allowed the agency to turn Windows file servers into covert attack machines that can silently infect other computers of interest inside a targeted network.
Athena ‚Äì A CIA's spyware framework that has been designed to take full control over the infected Windows PCs remotely, and works against every version of Microsoft's Windows operating systems, from Windows XP to Windows 10.
AfterMidnight and Assassin ‚Äì Two alleged CIA malware frameworks for the Microsoft Windows platform that has been designed to monitor and report back actions on the infected remote host computer and execute malicious actions.
Archimedes ‚Äì Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack tool allegedly created by the CIA to target computers inside a Local Area Network (LAN).
Scribbles ‚Äì A piece of software reportedly designed to embed 'web beacons' into confidential documents, allowing the agency to track insiders and whistleblowers.
Grasshopper ‚Äì Framework which allowed the spying agency to easily create custom malware for breaking into Microsoft's Windows and bypassing antivirus protection.
Marble ‚Äì Source code of a secret anti-forensic framework, basically an obfuscator or a packer used by the CIA to hide the actual source of its malware.
Dark Matter ‚Äì Hacking exploits the agency designed to target iPhones and Macs.
Weeping Angel ‚Äì Spying tool used by the agency to infiltrate smart TV's, transforming them into covert microphones.
Year Zero ‚Äì Alleged CIA hacking exploits for popular hardware and software.

As part of its ongoing Vault 7 leaks, the whistleblower organisation WikiLeaks today revealed about a CIA contractor responsible for analysing advanced malware and hacking techniques being used in the wild by cyber criminals.

According to the documents leaked by WikiLeaks,<span class="highlight-match"> Raytheon </span>Blackbird Technologies, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) contractor, submitted nearly five such reports to CIA as part of UMBRAGE Component Library (UCL) project between November 2014 and September 2015.

These reports contain brief analysis about proof-of-concept ideas and malware attack vectors ‚Äî publically presented by security researchers and secretly developed by cyber espionage hacking groups.

Reports submitted by Raytheon were allegedly helping CIA's Remote Development Branch (RDB) to collect ideas for developing their own advanced malware projects.

It was also revealed in previous Vault 7 leaks that CIA's UMBRAGE malware development teams also borrow codes from publicly available malware samples to built its own spyware tools.


Here's the list and brief information of each report:

Report 1 ‚Äî Raytheon analysts detailed a variant of the HTTPBrowser Remote Access Tool (RAT), which was probably developed in 2015.

The RAT, which is designed to capture keystrokes from the targeted systems, was being used by a Chinese cyber espionage APT group called 'Emissary Panda.'

Report 2 ‚Äî This document details a variant of the NfLog Remote Access Tool (RAT), also known as IsSpace, which was being used by Samurai Panda, Identified as another Chinese hacking group.

Equipped with Adobe Flash zero-day exploit CVE-2015-5122 (leaked in Hacking Team dump) and UAC bypass technique, this malware was also able to sniff or enumerate proxy credentials to bypass Windows Firewall.

Report 3 ‚Äî This report contains details about "Regin" -- a very sophisticated malware sample that has been spotted in operation since 2013 and majorly designed for surveillance and data collection.

Regin is a cyber espionage tool, which is said to be more sophisticated than both Stuxnet and Duqu and is believed to be developed by the US intelligence agency NSA.

The malware uses a modular approach that allowed an operator to enable a customised spying. Regin's design makes the malware highly suited for persistent, long-term mass surveillance operations against targets.

Report 4 ‚Äî It details a suspected Russian State-sponsored malware sample called "HammerToss," which was discovered in early 2015 and suspected of being operational since late 2014.

What makes HammerToss interesting is its architecture, which leverages Twitter accounts, GitHub accounts, compromised websites, and Cloud-storage to orchestrate command-and-control functions to execute the commands on the targeted systems.

Report 5 ‚Äî This document details the self-code injection and API hooking methods of information stealing Trojan called "Gamker."

Gamker uses simple decryption, then drops a copy of itself using a random filename and injects itself into a different process. The trojan also exhibits other typical trojan behaviours.

Here we are with our weekly roundup, briefing this week's top cyber security threats, incidents and challenges.

This week has been very short with big news from shutting down of two of the largest Dark Web marketplaces and theft of millions of dollars in the popular Ethereum cryptocurrency to the discovery of new Linux malware leveraging SambaCry exploit.

We are here with the outline of this week's stories, just in case you missed any of them. We recommend you read the entire thing (just click 'Read More' because there's some valuable advice in there as well).

Here's the list of this Week's Top Stories:


1. Feds Shuts Down AlphaBay and Hansa Dark Web Markets ‚Äî Dream Market Under Suspicion

On Thursday, Europol announced that the authorities had shut down two of the largest criminal Dark Web markets ‚Äî AlphaBay and Hansa ‚Äî in what's being called the largest-ever international operation against the dark web's black market conducted by the FBI, DEA and Dutch National Police.

Interestingly, the federal authorities shut down AlphaBay, but before taking down Hansa market, they took control of the Dark Web market and kept it running for at least a month in an effort to monitor the activities of its visitors, including a massive flood of Alphabay refugees.

After the shutdown of both AlphaBay and Hansa, Dream Market has emerged as the leading player, which has been in business since 2013, but it has now been speculated by many dark web users that Dream Market is also under police control.

2. New Ransomware Threatens to Send Your Internet History to All Your Friends

After WannaCry and Petya ransomware outbreaks, a new strain of ransomware has been making the rounds on the Google Play Store in bogus apps, which targets Android mobile phone users.

Dubbed LeakerLocker, instead of encrypting files on your device, this Android ransomware secretly collects personal images, messages and browsing history and then threatens to share them with your contacts if you don't pay $50 (¬£38).

For more detailed information on the LeakerLocker ransomware ‚Äî Read more.


3. New CIA Leaks ‚Äî Smartphone Hacking and Malware Development


WikiLeaks last week published the 16th batch of its ongoing Vault 7 leak, revealing the CIA's Highrise Project that allowed the spying agency to stealthy collect and forwards stolen data from compromised smartphones to its server through SMS messages.

This week, the whistleblowing organisation revealed about a CIA contractor ‚Äî<span class="highlight-match"> Raytheon </span>Blackbird Technologies ‚Äî who was responsible for analysing advanced malware and hacking techniques being used in the wild by cyber criminals.

For more detailed information on Highrise Project and its contractor Raytheon Blackbird Technologies ‚Äî Read More.


4. Three Back-to-Back Multi-Million Dollar Ethereum Heist in 20 Days

This week, an unknown hacker stole nearly $32 Million worth of Ethereum ‚Äì one of the most popular and increasingly valuable cryptocurrencies ‚Äì from wallet accounts linked to at least three companies by exploiting a critical vulnerability in Parity's Ethereum Wallet software.

This was the third Ethereum cryptocurrency heist that came out two days after an alleged hacker stole $7.4 Million worth of Ether from trading platform CoinDash and two weeks after someone hacked into South Korean cryptocurrency exchange and stole more than $1 Million in Ether and Bitcoins from user accounts.

For more detailed information about the Ethereum Heist ‚Äî Read More.


5. Critical Gnome Flaw Leaves Linux PCs Vulnerable

This week has been bad for Linux users as well. A security researcher discovered a code injection vulnerability in the thumbnail handler component of GNOME Files file manager that allowed hackers to execute malicious code on targeted Linux machines.

German researcher Nils Dagsson Moskopp dubbed the vulnerability Bad Taste (CVE-2017-11421) and also released proof-of-concept (PoC) code on his blog to demonstrate the vulnerability.

For more details about the Bad Taste vulnerability and its PoC ‚Äî Read More.


6. New Malware Exploits SambaCry to Hijack NAS Devices


Despite being patched in late May, the SambaCry vulnerability is currently being leveraged by a new piece of malware to target the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances.

SambaCry is a 7-year-old critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) in Samba networking software that could allow a hacker to remotely take full control of a vulnerable Linux and Unix machines.

The flaw was discovered and patched two months ago, but researchers at Trend Micro warned that the flaw had been actively exploited by the SHELLBIND malware that mostly targets NAS devices used by small and medium-size businesses.

For more detailed information on the SHELLBIND malware ‚Äî Read More.


7. Devil's Ivy ‚Äî Millions of Internet-Connected Devices At Risk

This week, researchers at the IoT-focused security firm Senrio discovered a critical remotely exploitable vulnerability in an open-source software development library used by major  IoT manufacturers that eventually left millions of smart devices vulnerable to hacking.

Dubbed Devil's Ivy, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-9765) in the gSOAP toolkit (Simple Object Access Protocol) ‚Äî an advanced C/C++ auto-coding tool for developing XML Web services and XML application.

The researchers also released proof-of-concept (PoC) video demonstrating the RCE on a security camera manufactured by Axis Communications.

For more detailed information on the Devil's Ivy and PoC video ‚Äî Read More.


8. ‚ÄúUbuntu Linux for Windows 10 Released‚Äù ‚Äî Sounds So Weird?

Downloading an entire operating system has just become as easy as downloading an application for Windows 10 users, as Microsoft last week announced the availability of popular Linux distro 'Ubuntu' in the Windows App Store.

While the company announced its plans to launch Fedora and SUSE Linux as well on Windows Store, the company did not reveal exactly when its users can expect to see these two flavours of Linux distro on the App Store.

For detailed information on how to install and run Ubuntu on Windows 10 ‚Äî Read More.


9. Over 70,000 Memcached Servers Vulnerable to Hacking


It's been almost eight months since the Memcached developers have patched several critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in the software, but tens of thousands of servers running Memcached application are still vulnerable.

Cisco's Talos intelligence and research group last year discovered three critical RCE vulnerabilities in Memcached ‚Äî a moderhttp://thehackernews.com/2017/07/segway-hoverboard-hacking.htmln open-source and easily deployable distributed caching system that allows objects to be stored in memory.

The vulnerability exposed major websites including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, to hackers, but the team of researchers scanned the internet on two different occasions and found that over 70,000 servers are still vulnerable to the attacks, including ransomware attacks similar to the one that hit MongoDB databases in late December.

For more in-depth information on the Memcached vulnerabilities ‚Äî Read More.


10. Tor Launches Bug Bounty Program for Public

After its intention to launch a public bug bounty program in late December 2015, the Tor Project has finally launched a "Bug Bounty Program," encouraging hackers and security researchers to find and privately report bugs that could compromise the anonymity network.

The bug bounty reports will be sent through HackerOne ‚Äî a startup that operates bug bounty programs for companies including Yahoo, Twitter, Slack, Dropbox, Uber, General Motors ‚Äì and even the U.S. Department of Defense for Hack the Pentagon initiative.

For detailed information on bug bounty prices and types of valid vulnerabilities ‚Äî Read More.

Every week since March Wikileaks has been leaking secrets from the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), which mainly focus on surveillance techniques and hacking tools employed by its agents.

However this time, the whistleblower organisation has released something different from its previous Vault 7 leaks, because it's not about hacking and spying; instead, it's a‚ÄîMissile Control System.

Dubbed Project Protego, the PIC-based missile control system is installed on-board a Pratt and Whitney Aircraft (PWA) equipped with missile launch system, which gives it ability to hit air-to-air and air-to-ground targets.

The latest leak contains four secret documents in total from the project Protego, along with "37 related documents (proprietary hardware/software manuals from Microchip Technology Inc)," WikiLeaks says.


Leaked documents reveal system design, a guide on how to configure and build Protego images, and also suggest that all micro-controller units exchange data and signals over encrypted and authenticated channels.

"The missile system has micro-controllers for the missile itself ('Missile Smart Switch', MSS), the tube ('Tube Smart Switch', TSS) and the collar (which holds the missile before and at launch time)."
The missile launches only when the Master Processor (MP) unit receives three valid signals from a beacon, including 'In Border,' 'Valid GPS,' and 'No End of Operational Period.'

WikiLeaks is not sure why the secret documents of project Protego were the part of repositories that belongs to the CIA's Engineering Development Group, who are apparently known for developing malware and hacking tools for the agency.

However, notably, the CIA has developed Protego missile control system in partnership with one of a major U.S. defence contractor,<span class="highlight-match"> Raytheon,</span> who was also mentioned in a previous CIA leak.

Raytheon is the same company that the agency hired for analysing advanced malware and hacking techniques being used in the wild by hackers and cyber criminals.

It seems the name, Protego, has been inspired from the magical Shield Charm used in Harry Potter movies, which helped from physical attacks as wells as magical.

If so, then the primary objective of this missile control system could be to defend something (secret facility or base), from external physical attacks.


Previous Vault 7 Leaks

Last week, WikiLeaks published another CIA project, dubbed AngelFire, which is an implant developed by the agency to implant a persistent backdoor on the target Windows computers by modifying their partition boot sector.

Since March, WikiLeaks has published 23 batches of "Vault 7" series, which includes the latest and last week leaks, along with the following batches:

HummingBad ‚Äì an Android-based malware that infected over 10 million Android devices around the world last year and made its gang an estimated US$300,000 per month at its peak ‚Äì has made a comeback.

Security researchers have discovered a new variant of the HummingBad malware hiding in more than 20 Android apps on Google Play Store.

The infected apps were already downloaded by over 12 Million unsuspecting users before the Google Security team removed them from the Play Store.

Dubbed HummingWhale by researchers at security firm Check Point, the new malware utilizes new, cutting-edge techniques that allow the nasty software to conduct Ad fraud better than ever before and generate revenue for its developers.

The Check Point researchers said the HummingWhale-infected apps had been published under the name of fake Chinese developers on the Play Store with common name structure, com.[name].camera, but with suspicious startup behaviors.

"It registered several events on boot, such as TIME_TICK, SCREEN_OFF and INSTALL_REFERRER which [were] dubious in that context," Check Point researchers said in a blog post published Monday.


HummingWhale Runs Malicious Apps in a Virtual Machine


The HummingWhale malware is tricky than HummingBad, as it uses a disguised Android application package (APK) file that acts as a dropper which downloads and runs further apps on the victim's smartphone.

If the victim notices and closes its process, the APK file then drops itself into a virtual machine in an effort to make it harder to detect.

The dropper makes use of an Android plugin created by the popular Chinese security vendor<span class="highlight-match"> Qihoo 360 </span>to upload malicious apps to the virtual machine, allowing HummingWhale to further install other apps without having to elevate permissions, and disguises its malicious activity to get onto Google Play.

"This .apk operates as a dropper, used to download and execute additional apps, similar to the tactics employed by previous versions of HummingBad," researchers said. "However, this dropper went much further. It uses an Android plugin called DroidPlugin, originally developed by Qihoo 360, to upload fraudulent apps on a virtual machine."


HummingWhale Runs Without having to Root the Android Device

Thanks to the virtual machine (VM), the HummingWhale malware no longer needs to root Android devices unlike HummingBad and can install any number of malicious or fraudulent apps on the victim's devices without overloading their smartphones.

Once the victim gets infected, the command and control (C&C) server send fake ads and malicious apps to the user, which runs in a VM, generating a fake referrer ID used to spoof unique users for ad fraud purposes and generate revenue.

Alike the original HummingBad, the purpose of HummingWhale is to make lots of money through ad fraud and fake app installations.

Besides all these malicious capabilities, the HummingWhale malware also tries to raise its reputation on Google Play Store using fraudulent ratings and comments, the tactic similar to the one utilized by the Gooligan malware.

The brand new Android smartphone launched by Google just a few months back has been hacked by Chinese hackers just in less than a minute.

Yes, the Google's latest Pixel smartphone has been hacked by a team white-hat hackers from<span class="highlight-match"> Qihoo 360,</span> besides at the 2016 PwnFest hacking competition in Seoul.

The Qihoo 360 team demonstrated a proof-of-concept exploit that used a zero-day vulnerability in order to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the target smartphone.

The exploit then launched the Google Play Store on the Pixel smartphone before opening Google Chrome and displaying a web page that read "Pwned By 360 Alpha Team," the Reg media reports.

Qihoo 360 won $120,000 cash prize for hacking the Pixel.


Google will now work to patch the vulnerability.

Besides the Google Pixel, Microsoft Edge running under Windows 10 was also hacked in PwnFest hacking competition. 

The Qihoo 360 team also hacked Adobe Flash with a combination of a decade-old, use-after-free zero-day vulnerability and a win32k kernel flaw to win a $120k prize.

Along with hacker JH, Chinese iPhone jailbreak team Pangu, which release million-dollar iOS jailbreaks for free, discovered a Safari exploit that used a privilege escalation zero-day flaw, giving them root access on Apple's updated Safari browser running on MacOS Sierra in just 20 seconds.

The exploit earned the team $80,000.


Hackers Compromised Microsoft Edge is just 18 seconds


Researchers from Qihoo 360 and South Korean security researcher Junghoon Lee, aka LokiHardt, completely hacked the Microsoft Edge web browser operating on Windows 10 Red Stone 1 in just 18 seconds.

The security experts gained SYSTEM-level remote code execution on Edge, although they denied disclosing details of the vulnerability until the affected vendors come with a fix. Both researchers earned $140,000 for their Edge exploit.

Another Qihoo hacker team and Lee both, for the first time, remotely compromised VMware Workstation 12.5.1 without user interaction, bagging $150,000 for their exploits.

Details of all the exploits will be reported to the respected companies so that they can patch their software before black-hat hackers use them for malicious purposes.

The Qihoo 360 team of hackers walked away with a total prize money of $520,000.

The OpenSSL Foundation has patched over a dozen vulnerabilities in its cryptographic code library, including a high severity bug that can be exploited for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

OpenSSL is a widely used open-source cryptographic library that provides encrypted Internet connections using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the majority of websites, as well as other secure services.

The vulnerabilities exist in OpenSSL versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 and patched in OpenSSL versions 1.1.0a, 1.0.2i and 1.0.1u.

The Critical-rated bug (CVE-2016-6304) can be exploited by sending a large OCSP Status Request extension on the targeted server during connection negotiations, which causes memory exhaustion to launch DoS attacks, the OpenSSL Project said.

What is OCSP Protocol?
OCSP(Online Certificate Status Protocol), supported by all modern web browsers, is a protocol designed to perform verification and obtain the revocation status of a digital certificate attached to a website.

OCSP divided into client and server components. When an application or a web browser attempts to verify an SSL certificate, the client component sends a request to an online responder via HTTP protocol, which in turn, returns the status of the certificate, valid or not.

Reported by Shi Lei, a researcher at Chinese security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Qihoo 360,</span> the vulnerability affects servers in their default configuration even if they do not support OCSP.
"An attacker could use the TLS extension "TLSEXT_TYPE_status_request" and fill the OCSP ids with continually renegotiation," the researcher explained in a blog post.

"Theoretically, an attacker could continually renegotiation with the server thus causing unbounded memory growth on the server up to 64k each time."¬†How to Prevent OpenSSL DoS Attack
 Administrators can mitigate damage by running 'no-ocsp.' Furthermore, servers using older versions of OpenSSL prior to 1.0.1g are not vulnerable in their default configuration.

Another moderate severity vulnerability (CVE-2016-6305) that can be exploited to launch denial of service attacks is fixed in the patch release, affecting OpenSSL 1.1.0 that was launched less than one month ago.

The team has also resolved a total of 12 low severity vulnerabilities in the latest versions of OpenSSL, but most of them do not affect the 1.1.0 branch.

It is worth noting that the OpenSSL Project will end support for OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on 31st December 2016, so users will not receive any security update from the beginning of 2017. Therefore users are advised to upgrade in order to avoid any security issues.

As part of its "October Patch Tuesday," Microsoft has today released a large batch of security updates to patch a total of 62 vulnerabilities in its products, including a severe MS office zero-day flaw that has been exploited in the wild.

Security updates also include patches for Microsoft Windows operating systems, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Skype, Microsoft Lync and Microsoft SharePoint Server.

Besides the MS Office vulnerability, the company has also addressed two other publicly disclosed (but not yet targeted in the wild) vulnerabilities that affect the SharePoint Server and the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

October patch Tuesday also fixes a critical Windows DNS vulnerability that could be exploited by a malicious DNS server to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system. Below you can find a brief technical explanation of all above mentioned critical and important vulnerabilities.

Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11826)

This vulnerability, classified by Microsoft as "important," is caused by a memory corruption issue. It affects all supported versions of MS Office and has been actively exploited by the attackers in targeted attacks.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability either by sending a specially crafted Microsoft Office file to the victims and convincing them to open it, or hosting a site containing specially crafted files and tricking victims to visit it.

Once opened, the malicious code within the booby-trapped Office file will execute with the same rights as the logged-in user. So, users with least privilege on their systems are less impacted than those having higher admin rights.

The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by security researchers at China-based security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Qihoo 360 </span>Core Security, who initially detected an in-the-wild cyber attack which involved malicious RTF files and leveraged this vulnerability on September 28.


Microsoft Windows DNSAPI Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11779)

Among other critical vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft include a critical remote code execution flaw in the Windows DNS client that affects computers running Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, and Windows Server 2012 through 2016.

The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious DNS response, allowing an attacker gain arbitrary code execution on Windows clients or Windows Server installations in the context of the software application that made the DNS request.

Nick Freeman, a security researcher from security firm Bishop Fox, discovered the vulnerability and demonstrated how an attacker connected to a public Wi-Fi network could run malicious code on a victim's machine, escalate privileges and take full control over the target computer or server.

"This means that if an attacker controls your DNS server (e.g., through a Man-in-the-Middle attack or a malicious coffee-shop hotspot) ‚Äì they can gain access to your system," the researcher explains.

"This doesn‚Äôt only affect web browsers ‚Äì your computer makes DNS queries in the background all the time, and any query can be responded to in order to trigger this issue."


For full technical details, you can watch the video demonstration by Bishop Fox‚Äôs Dan Petro and head on to Bishop Fox‚Äôs blog post.

Windows Subsystem for Linux Denial of Service Vulnerability (CVE-2017-8703)

This denial of service (DoS) issue is yet another noteworthy vulnerability which resides in Windows Subsystem for Linux.

The vulnerability, classified by Microsoft as "important," was previously publicly disclosed, but wasn't found actively exploited in the wild.

The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute a malicious application to affect an object in the memory, which eventually allows that the application to crash the target system and made it unresponsive.

The only affected Microsoft product by this vulnerability is Windows 10 (Version 1703). "The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Subsystem for Linux handles objects in memory," Microsoft said in its advisory.


Microsoft Office SharePoint XSS Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11777)

Another previously disclosed but not yet under attack vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in Microsoft SharePoint Server that affects SharePoint Enterprise Server 2013 Service Pack 1 and SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016.

The vulnerability, also classified by Microsoft as "important," can be exploited by sending a maliciously crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and execute malicious script in the same security context of the current user.

"The attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorised to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user," Microsoft explains.
Besides these, the company has patched a total of 19 vulnerabilities in the scripting engine in Edge and Internet Explorer that could allow web pages to achieve remote-code execution, with the logged-in user's permissions, via memory corruption flaws.

Just opening a web page could potentially land you in trouble by executing malware, spyware, ransomware, and other nasty software on the vulnerable computer.


More RCE And Other Vulnerabilities

Redmond also patched two vulnerabilities in the Windows font library that can allow a web page or document to execute malicious code on a vulnerable machine and hijack it on opening a file with a specially crafted embedded font or visiting a website hosting the malicious file.

The update also includes fixes for a bug in Windows TRIE (CVE-2017-11769) that allows DLL files to achieve remote code execution, a programming error (CVE-2017-11776) in Outlook that leaves its emails open to snooping over supposedly secure connections.

Other issues patched this month include two remote code execution flaws in the Windows Shell and a remote code execution bug in Windows Search.

Microsoft also published an advisory warning user of a security feature bypass issue affecting the firmware of Infineon Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs).

Surprisingly, Adobe Flash does not include any security patches. Meanwhile, Adobe has skipped October's Patch Tuesday altogether.

Users are strongly advised to apply October security patches as soon as possible in order to keep hackers and cybercriminals away from taking control over their computers.

For installing security updates, simply head on to Settings ‚Üí Update & security ‚Üí Windows Update ‚Üí Check for updates, or you can install the updates manually.

Apple yesterday rolled out a new version of its macOS operating system, dubbed High Sierra 10.13‚Äîa few hours before an ex-NSA hacker publicly disclosed the details of a critical vulnerability that affects High Sierra as well as all earlier versions of macOS.

Patrick Wardle, an ex-NSA hacker and now head of research at security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Synack,</span> found a critical zero-day vulnerability in macOS that could allow any installed application to steal usernames and plaintext passwords of online accounts stored in the Mac Keychain.

The macOS Keychain is a built-in password management system that helps Apple users securely store passwords for applications, servers, websites, cryptographic keys and credit card numbers‚Äîwhich can be accessed using only a user-defined master password.

Typically no application can access the contents of Keychain unless the user enters the master password.


"I discovered a flaw where malicious non-privileged code (or apps) could programmatically access the keychain and dump all this data .... including your plain text passwords. This is not something that is supposed to happen!," Wardle said.

Wardle yesterday posted a proof-of-concept video of the exploit, demonstrating how the hack can be used to exfiltrate every single plaintext password from Keychain without requiring the user to enter the master password.


The video shows how a malicious installed application, signed or unsigned, allowed an attacker to remotely steal all the passwords stored in the keychain and does not notify the user of the attack either.

"macOS is designed to be secure by default, and Gatekeeper warns users against installing unsigned apps, like the one shown in this proof of concept, and prevents them from launching the app without explicit approval," said Apple in a statement released today.

"We encourage users to download software only from trusted sources like the Mac App Store and to pay careful attention to security dialogs that macOS presents."

Wardle claimed that he reported the issue to Apple last month, and made the public disclosure when the company planned to release High Sierra without fixing the vulnerability, which not only affects the newest version but also older versions of macOS.

Earlier this month Patrick¬†disclosed¬†another flaw in macOS High Sierra's kernel extension SKEL (Secure Kernel Extension Loading) security feature that could allow an attacker to run any third-party at kernel level extension without requiring user approval.

Apple Mac Computers are considered to be much safer than Windows at keeping viruses and malware out of its environment, but that‚Äôs simply not true anymore.

It's not because Mac OS X is getting worse every day, but because hackers are getting smart and sophisticated these days.

The bad news for Mac users is that malware targeting webcams and microphones has now come up for Mac laptops as well.

Patrick Wardle, an ex-NSA staffer who heads up research at security intelligence firm<span class="highlight-match"> Synack,</span> discovered a way for Mac malware to tap into your live feeds from Mac's built-in webcam and microphone to locally record you even without detection.

Wardle is the same researcher who has discovered a number of security weaknesses in Apple products, including ways to bypass the Gatekeeper protections in OS X.

Wardle also released a free tool called RansomWhere? earlier this year that has generic detection capabilities for Mac OS X ransomware variants.

Wardle is scheduled to present his new findings at the Virus Bulletin conference in Denver later today, along with his research demonstrating how malware could easily piggyback on your legitimate webcam sessions to keep its spying activity hidden.

Yes, piggybacking legitimate webcam sessions initiated by you.

Here's How Mac Malware Works:
Since Mac's firmware-level protection lights the green LED for any unauthorized access to user's webcam, Wardle believes that attackers can use a malicious app that quietly monitors the system for any outgoing feed of an existing webcam session ‚Äì like a Skype or FaceTime call ‚Äì where the light indicator would already be ON.

The malware then piggybacks the victim's webcam or microphone to secretly record both audio and video session, without any visible indication of this malicious activity and any fear of detection.

In his paper presentation, titled 'Getting Duped: Piggybacking on Webcam Streams for Surreptitious Recordings,' Wardle outlines the threat along with countermeasures to detect "secondary" processes that try to access an existing video session on OS X.

How to Prevent Your WebCam and Mic from Being HackedWardle has developed and released a free tool, dubbed OverSight, which not only monitors webcam and microphone activities but also alerts you when a secondary process accesses your webcam, asking whether you want to allow or block access.

Oversight is a free download from Wardle‚Äôs website.

Moreover, physically covering your webcam ‚Äì like what Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and FBI Director James Comey do ‚Äì also offers a low-tech approach to keeping snoopers away.

	      Watch Out! First-Ever Word Macro Malware for Apple Mac OS Discovered in the Wild [1.03 Points on average]

After targeting Windows-based computers over the past few years, hackers are now shifting their interest to Macs as well.

The emergence of the first macro-based Word document attack against Apple's macOS platform is the latest example to prove this.

The concept of Macros dates back to 1990s. You might be familiar with the message that reads: "Warning: This document contains macros."

Macro is a series of commands and actions that help automate some tasks. Microsoft Office programs support Macros written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), but they can also be used for malicious activities like installing malware.

Until now, hackers were cleverly using this technique to target Windows.

However, security researchers have now detected the first in-the-wild instance of hackers are making use of malicious macros in Word documents to install malware on Mac computers and steal your data ‚Äì an old Windows technique.

The hack tricks victims into opening infected Word documents that subsequently run malicious macros. One such malicious Word file discovered by the researcher was titled "U.S. Allies and Rivals Digest Trump's Victory ‚Äì Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.docm."

However, after clicking on the malicious Word document and before running it on your system, Mac users are always prompted to enable macros.

Denying permission can save you, but if enabled ignoring warnings, the embedded macro executes a function, coded in Python, that downloads the malware payload to infect the Mac PCs, allowing hackers to monitor webcams, access browser history logs, and steal password and encryption keys.

According to a blog post published this week by Patrick Wardle, director of research at security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Synack,</span> the Python function is virtually identical to EmPyre ‚Äì an open source Mac and Linux post-exploitation agent.
"It‚Äôs kind of a low-tech solution, but on one hand it‚Äôs abusing legitimate functionality so it‚Äôs not going to crash like a memory corruption or overflow might, and it‚Äôs not going to be patched out," said Wardle.Wardle tracked the IP address from which the malicious Word documents were spread to Russia and that IP has previously been associated with malicious activities like phishing attacks.

Another malicious attack discovered by researchers this week also relied on standard Windows techniques by prompting users to download and install a fake software update, but actually harvest the user Keychain, phish usernames and passwords, and other sensitive data.

The MacDownloader nasty virus presented itself as both an update for Adobe Flash and the Bitdefender Adware Removal Tool, which are always annoying and dismissed by most users.

This is what all attackers want. Once the user clicks on either reject the updates or just press yes to dismiss it once and for all, the malware gets the green signal to harvest user keychain, phish usernames and passwords, collect private and sensitive data, and then send them back to attackers.

Researchers have spotted macOS malware targeting mostly the defense industry and reported to have been used against a human rights advocate.

The best way to avoid these kinds of attacks is to just deny permission to enable macros from running when opening a suspicious Word document and avoid downloading software from third-party App Store or untrusted websites.

Yes, even Mac could also get viruses that could silently spy on its users. So, if you own a Mac and think you are immune to malware, you are wrong.

An unusual piece of malware that can remotely take control of webcams, screen, mouse, keyboards, and install additional malicious software has been infecting hundreds of Mac computers for more than five years‚Äîand it was detected just a few months back.

Dubbed FruitFly, the Mac malware was initially detected earlier this year by Malwarebytes researcher Thomas Reed, and Apple quickly released security patches to address the dangerous malware.

Now months later, Patrick Wardle, an ex-NSA hacker and now chief security researcher at security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Synack,</span> discovered around 400 Mac computers infected with the newer strain of the FruitFly malware (FruitFly 2) in the wild.

Wardle believes the number of infected Macs with FruitFly 2 would likely be much higher, as he only had access to some servers used to control FruitFly.

Although it is unknown who is behind FruitFly or how the malware gets into Mac computers, the researchers believe the nasty malware has been active for around ten years, as some of its code dates back to as far as 1998.

"FruitFly, the first OS X/macOS malware of 2017, is a rather intriguing specimen. Selectively targeting biomedical research institutions, it is thought to have flown under the radar for many years," Wardle wrote in the abstract of his talk, which he is going to present at the Black Hat later this week.
Since the initial infection vector for FruitFly is unclear, like most malware, Fruitfly could likely infect Macs either through an infected website delivering the infection or via phishing emails or a booby-trapped application.

FruitFly is surveillance malware that's capable of executing shell commands, moving and clicking a mouse cursor, capturing webcam, killing processes, grabbing the system's uptime, retrieving screen captures, and even alerting the hacker when victims are again active on their Mac.

"The only reason I can think of that this malware has not been spotted before now is that it is being used in very tightly targeted attacks, limiting its exposure," Reed wrote in the January blog post.¬†

"Although there is no evidence at this point linking this malware to a specific group, the fact that it has been seen specifically at biomedical research institutions certainly seems like it could be the result of exactly that kind of espionage."
Wardle was able to uncover FruitFly victims after registering a backup command and control (C&C) server that was once used by the attacker. He then noticed around 400 Mac users infected with FruitFly started connecting to that server.

From there, the researcher was also able to see IP addresses of FruitFly infected victims, indicating 90 percent of victims were located in the United States.

Wardle was even able to see the name of victims' Macs as well, making it "really easy to pretty accurately say who is getting infected," he told Forbes.

But rather than taking over those computers or spying on the victims, Wardle contacted law enforcement and handed over what he found to law enforcement agents, who are now investigating the matter.

Wardle believes surveillance was the primary purpose of FruitFly, though it is yet unclear whether it is government or other hacker groups.

"This did not look like cyber crime type behaviour; there were no ads, no keyloggers, or ransomware," Wardle said. "Its features had looked like they were actions that would support interactivity‚Äîit had the ability to alert the attacker when users were active on the computer, it could simulate mouse clicks and keyboard events."
Since the Fruitfly's code even includes Linux shell commands, the malware would work just fine on Linux operating system. So, it would not come as a surprise if a Linux variant of Fruitfly was in operation.

Rapidly growing, insecure internet-connected devices are becoming albatross around the necks of individuals and organizations with malware authors routinely hacking them to form botnets that can be further used as weapons in DDoS and other cyber attacks.

But now finding malicious servers, hosted by attackers, that control botnet of infected machines gets a bit easier. Thanks to Shodan and<span class="highlight-match"> Recorded Future.</span>

Shodan and Recorded Future have teamed up and launched Malware Hunter ‚Äì a crawler that scans the Internet regularly to identify botnet command and control (C&C) servers for various malware and botnets.

Command-and-control servers (C&C servers) are centralized machines that control the bots (computers, smart appliances or smartphones), typically infected with Remote Access Trojans or data-stealing malware, by sending commands and receiving data.

Malware Hunter results have been integrated into Shodan ‚Äì a search engine designed to gather and list information about all types of Internet-connected devices and systems.


How Does¬†Malware Hunter Identify a C&C Server?

You might be wondering how Malware Hunter will get to know which IP address is being used to host a malicious C&C server.

For this, Shodan has deployed specialized crawlers, to scan the whole Internet to look for computers and devices configured to function as a botnet C&C server by pretending to be infected computer that is reporting back to the command and control server.

The crawler effectively reports back to every IP address on the Web as if the target IP is a C&C and if it gets a positive response, then it knows the IP is a malicious C&C server.

"RATs return specific responses (strings) when a proper request is presented on the RAT controller's listener port," according to a 15-page report [PDF] published by Recorded Future.

"In some cases, even a basic TCP three-way handshake is sufficient to elicit a RAT controller response. The unique response is a fingerprint indicating that a RAT controller (control panel) is running on the computer in question."


Malware Hunter Already Identified Over 5,700 Malicious C&C Servers


We gave it a try and found impressive results, briefly mentioned below:


Malware Hunter has already identified over 5,700 command-and-control servers around the World.
Top 3 Countries hosting command and control servers include United States (72%), Hong Kong (12%) and China (5.2%).
Five popular Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that are widely being used include Gh0st RAT Trojan (93.5%), DarkComet trojan (3.7%), along with a few servers belong to njRAT Trojan, ZeroAccess Trojan, and XtremeRAT Trojan.
Shodan is also able to identify C&C servers for Black Shades, Poison Ivy, and Net Bus.


To see results, all you have to do is search for "category:malware" without quotes on Shodan website.

Malware Hunter aims at making it easier for security researchers to identify newly hosted C&C servers, even before having access to respective malware samples.

This intelligence gathering would also help anti-virus vendors identify undetectable malware and prevent it from sending your stolen data back to attacker's command-and-control servers.

A new powerful hacking tool recently introduced in an underground forum is making rounds these days, allowing anyone to rapidly conduct website scans for SQL injection flaws on a massive scale ‚Äî all controlled from a smartphone using the Telegram messaging application.

Dubbed Katyusha Scanner, the fully automated powerful SQLi vulnerability scanner was first surfaced in April this year when a Russian-speaking individual published it on a popular hacking forum.

Researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Recorded Future'</span>s Insikt Group threat intelligence division found this tool for sale on an underground hacking forum for just $500. Users can even rent the Katyusha Scanner tool for $200.

According to the researchers, Katyusha Scanner is a web-based tool that's a combination of Arachni Scanner and a basic SQL Injection exploitation tool that allows users to automatically identify SQLi vulnerable sites and then exploits it to take over its databases.

Arachni is an open source vulnerability scanning tool aimed towards helping users evaluate the security of their web applications.

What makes this tool stand out of line is its 'Infrastructure-as-a-Service' model.


Remotely Control Hacking Tool Via Telegram


Katyusha Scanner is abusing the Telegram messaging application to control its operations, such as sending and receiving commands.

The Katyusha Scanner tool is quite easy to setup and use, allowing anyone to conduct large-scale penetration attacks against a large number of targeted websites simultaneously with the mere use of their smartphones.

The Pro version of the tool not just identifies vulnerable websites, but also allows hackers to establish a "strong foothold within vulnerable web servers" and automatically extract "privileged information such as login credentials."

Once the scan is complete, Katyusha Scanner sends a text message to the criminals with the vulnerable site name, its Alexa web ratings, helping criminals identify popular websites that would likely be more profitable for them to attack, and the number of databases.

The criminals, even with no technical knowledge, can download any exfiltrated data available by just clicking on their smartphones to issue commands.

Katyusha Scanner also allows for the automatic dumping of databases and can be used on both Linux as well as Windows machines.

"The availability of a highly robust and inexpensive tool...Katyusha Scanner to online criminals with limited technical skills will only intensify the compromised data problem experienced by various businesses, highlighting the importance of regular infrastructure security audits," researchers at Recorded Future wrote.
Many buyers praised the quality of the tool on the black market site, one of the satisfied customers who got immediate success in obtaining access to eight web servers wrote:

"Excellent support! The seller has configured the software for my server, which was failing before, however, right now it flies divinely! I highly recommend the software, and it has found eight SQL vulnerabilities in half a day, great automation of the routine. Very grateful to the seller."
Another wrote: "The author has helped with the product setup after the purchase, and (Katyusha) has immediately found SQL vulnerability. Thank you for the great product."

Initially, Katyusha Scanner was sold for $500, but due to unexpectedly high demand, a light version of the tool with slightly limited functionality was released on May 10, 2017, at just $250.

With the release of the most recent Katyusha 0.8 Pro update at the end of June, the author also made the scanner available for rent at $200 per month for the first time.

Ransomware has been around for a few years, but it has become an albatross around everyone's neck, targeting businesses, hospitals, financial institutions and individuals worldwide and extorting millions of dollars.

Forget about developing sophisticated banking trojans and malware to steal money out of people and organizations. Today, one of the easiest ways that can help cyber criminals get paid effortlessly is Ransomware.

This threat became even worse after the arrival of ransomware as a service (RaaS) ‚Äì a variant of ransomware designed to be so user-friendly that anyone with little or no technical knowledge can also easily deploy them to make money.

Now, security researchers have uncovered an easy-to-use ransomware service that promises profit with just one successful infection.

Dubbed Karmen, the RaaS variant is based on the abandoned open-source ransomware building toolkit dubbed Hidden Tear and is being sold on Dark Web forums from Russian-speaking hacker named DevBitox for $175.

Like any typical ransomware infections, Karmen encrypts files on the infected PC using the strong AES-256 encryption protocol, making them inaccessible to the victim until he/she pays a large sum of money to obtain the decryption key from the attacker.

This new variant of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) provides buyers access to a web-based control panel hosted on the Dark Web with a user-friendly graphical dashboard that allows buyers to configure a personalised version of the Karmen ransomware.

The dashboard lets buyers keep a running tally of the number of infections and their profit in real time, allowing anyone with very minimal technical knowledge to deploy Karmen, threat intelligence firm<span class="highlight-match"> Recorded Future </span>said in a blog post published today.

Hacker: Don't Mess with my Malware; otherwise, Your Files are Gone!

Once infected, the Karmen ransomware encrypts the victim's files and shows a popup window with a threatening message warning users not to interfere with the malware; otherwise, they might lose all their files.

What's more interesting? Karmen automatically deletes its decryptor if a sandbox environment or analysis software is detected on the victim's computer to make security researchers away from investigating the threat.

Initial Karmen infections were reported in December 2016 by victims in Germany and the United States, while the sale in underground forums began in March 2017.

So far, 20 users have purchased copies of Karmen malware from DevBitox, according to Recorded Future, while three of those buyers have left positive reviews on their profile.

You can also watch a YouTube video demonstration which shows the RaaS in action.

How to Protect Yourself from Ransomware Threat?

Here are some important steps that should be considered safeguarding against ransomware infection:


Always keep regular backups of your important data.
Make sure you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your system.
Do not open email attachments from unknown sources.
Most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

Yes, you only need a single laptop with a decent internet connection, rather a massive botnet, to launch overwhelming denial of service (DoS) attacks in order to bring down major Internet servers and modern-day firewalls.

Researchers at TDC Security Operations Center have discovered a new attack technique that lone attackers with limited resources (in this case, a laptop and at least 15Mbps of bandwidth) can use to knock large servers offline.

Dubbed a BlackNurse attack or the low-rate "Ping of Death" attack, the technique can be used to launch several low-volume DoS attacks by sending specially formed Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets, or 'pings' that overwhelm the processors on server protected by firewalls from Cisco,<span class="highlight-match"> Palo Alto Networks,</span> among others.

ICMP is a protocol used by routers and other networking devices to send and receive error messages.

According to a technical report [PDF] published this week, the BlackNurse attack is more traditionally known as a "ping flood attack" and is based on ICMP Type 3 (Destination Unreachable) Code 3 (Port Unreachable) requests.

These requests are packet replies typically returned to ping sources when the destination port of a target is 'unreachable.'


Here's How the BlackNurse attack Works:

By sending a Type 3 ICMP packets with a code of 3, a hacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) state by overloading the CPUs of certain types of server firewalls, regardless of the quality of internet connection.

The BlackNurse traffic volume is very small, ranging from 15 Mbps to 18 Mbps (or about 40,000 to 50,000 packets per second), which is laughable compared to record-breaking 1.1 Tbps DDoS attack recorded against French Internet service provider OVH in September.

However, TDC explained this was not the problem, as the major issue is a steady stream of 40K to 50K ICMP packets that reach the victim's network equipment and keep crashing the target device.

The good news? The researcher said, "When an attack is ongoing, users from the LAN side will no longer be able to send/receive traffic to/from the Internet. All firewalls we've have seen recover when the attack stops."

In other words, this low-volume DoS technique remains effective because it is not flooding the firewall with traffic, but rather it is pushing high load onto the CPU, effectively knocking servers offline even if they've tons of network capacity.

Researchers said BlackNurse should not be confused with 'ping flood attacks based on ICMP Type 8 Code 0' ‚Äì regular ping traffic. Researchers explain:

"The BlackNurse attack attracted our attention because in our anti-DDoS solution we experienced that even though traffic speed and packets per second were very low, this attack could keep our customers' operations down."¬†

"This even applied to customers with large internet uplinks and large enterprise firewalls in place. We had expected that professional firewall equipment would be able to handle the attack."


Products Affected

The BlackNurse attack works against the following products:

Cisco ASA 5506, 5515, 5525 (default settings)
Cisco ASA 5550 (legacy) and 5515-X (latest generation)
Cisco Router 897 (can be mitigated)
SonicWall (misconfiguration can be changed and mitigated)
Some unverified Palo Alto
Zyxel NWA3560-N (wireless attack from LAN side)
Zyxel Zywall USG50


How to Mitigate the BlackNurse Attack?

The good news? There are ways to fight back the BlackNurse attacks.

TDC suggested some mitigations and SNORT IDS rules that could be used to detect BlackNurse attacks. Moreover, proof-of-concept (PoC) code posted by an OVH security engineer on GitHub can also be used by network admins to test their equipment against BlackNurse.

In order to mitigate the BlackNurse attacks on firewalls and other equipment, TDC recommended users to configure a list of trusted sources for which ICMP is allowed. However, the best way to mitigate the attack is to simply disable ICMP Type 3 Code 3 on the WAN interface.

Palo Alto Networks has also issued an advisory, saying that its devices are only affected in "very specific, non-default scenarios that contravene best practices." The company also lists some recommendations for its customers.

Meanwhile, Cisco said it does not consider the reported behavior to be a security issue, warning:

"We recommend that you grant permission for the ICMP unreachable message type (type 3). Denying ICMP unreachable messages disables ICMP Path MTU discovery, which can halt IPSec and PPTP traffic."
Moreover, independent software vendor NETRESEC also published a detailed analysis of BlackNurse in its post titled, "The 90's called and wanted their ICMP flood attack back."

Besides all these, the Sans Institute has also issued its own brief write-up on the BlackNurse attack, discussing the attack and what users should do in order to mitigate it.

This newly discovered bugs in Java and Python is a big deal today.

The two popular programming languages, Java and Python, contain similar security flaws that can be exploited to send unauthorized emails and bypass any firewall defenses.

And since both the flaws remain unpatched, hackers can take advantage to design potential cyber attack operations against critical networks and infrastructures.

The unpatched flaws actually reside in the way Java and Python programming languages handle File Transfer Protocol (FTP) links, where they don't syntax-check the username parameter, which leads to, what researchers call, protocol injection flaw.


Java/Python FTP Injection to Send Unauthorized SMTP Emails


In a blog post published over the past week, security researcher Alexander Klink detailed the FTP protocol injection vulnerability in Java's XML eXternal Entity (XXE) that allows attackers to inject non-FTP malicious commands inside an FTP connection request.

To demonstrate the attack, Alexander showed how to send an unauthorized email via SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) in an FTP connection attempt, even though the FTP connection failed, as FTP servers does support authentication, but doesn't check for the present of carriage returns (CR) or line feeds (LF) in usernames.

"This attack is particularly interesting in a scenario where you can reach an (unrestricted, maybe not even spam- or malware-filtering) internal mail server from the machine doing the XML parsing," Alexander concluded.


Java/Python FTP Injections Allow to Bypass Firewall

However, two days later in a separate security advisory, security researcher Timothy Morgan from Blindspot Security came forward with his findings, showing more threatening exploitation scenario where the FTP URL handlers in both Java and Python can be used to bypass firewalls.

Morgan said such FTP protocol injection flaw could be used to trick a victim's firewall into accepting TCP connections from the web to the vulnerable host's system on its "high" ports (from 1024 to 65535).

Besides the FTP protocol injection attack, there's reside a decade old security issue in FTP protocol called classic mode FTP ‚Äì an insecure mechanism of client-server FTP interactions, but many firewall vendors still support it by default.

When a classic mode FTP connection is initiated, the firewall temporarily opens a port ‚Äì typically between 1024 and 65535 ‚Äì specified in the PORT command, which introduces security risks.

Using the FTP protocol injection issue in Java and Python, an attacker who knows the targeted host‚Äôs internal IP address can start a classic mode FTP connection, which attackers can use for nefarious purposes.

Morgan has determined that an attacker can open up one port in the targeted firewall with only three requests:

Identify the victim's internal IP address ‚Äì this requires an attacker to "send an URL, see how the client behaves, then try another until the attack is successful."
Determine packet alignment and ensure that the PORT command is injected at the right moment, making the attack work.
Exploit the vulnerability.


Each additional request can be used to open up another TCP port.


Easily Exploitable Protocol Injection Flaw

However, the researcher warned that his exploit could be used for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, server-side request forgery (SSRF), an XEE attack and more ‚Äì and once bypassed the firewall, desktop hosts can be attacked even if they do not have Java installed.

All an attacker need is to convince victims into accessing a malicious Java or Python applications installed on a server to bypass the entire firewall.

"If a desktop user could be convinced to visit a malicious website while Java is installed, even if Java applets are disabled, they could still trigger Java Web Start to parse a JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol) file," Morgan said. "These files could contain malicious FTP URLs which trigger this bug."

"Also note, that since Java parses JNLP files before presenting the user with any security warnings, the attack can be entirely successful without any indication to the user (unless the browser itself warns the user about Java Web Start being launched)."
According to Morgan, a nearly identical flaw also exists in Python's urllib2 and urllib libraries, although "this injection appears to be limited to attacks via directory names specified in the URL."


Protocol Injection Flaw Is Still Unpatched

Morgan said the FTP protocol injection flaw was reported to the Python team in January 2016 and Oracle in November 2016 by his company, but neither of the two has issued any update to address the issue.

Morgan has developed a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit but is currently holding back publication of his exploit until Oracle and Python respond to the disclosure and release patches.

The Morgan's exploit has successfully been tested against<span class="highlight-match"> Palo Alto Networks </span>and Cisco ASA firewalls, though researchers believe many commercial firewalls are also vulnerable to FTP stream injection attacks.

So until patches become available, Morgan suggests users uninstall Java on their desktops and in browsers, as well as disable support for "classic mode" FTP on all firewalls.

Admit it. Who would not want their firewall maintenance grunt work to go away?

For more than 20 years, companies either managed their edge firewall appliances or had service providers rack-and-stack appliances in their data centers and did it for them.

This was called a managed firewall ‚Äî  an appliance wrapped with a managed service, often from a carrier or managed security service provider (MSSP).

The provider assumed the management of the firewall box, its software, and even its policy and management from the over-burdened IT team. But customers ended up paying for the inefficiency of dealing with appliances (i.e. ‚Äúgrunt work‚Äù) because the problem just shifted to the provider. A new architecture was needed - a transformation from an appliance form factor to a true cloud service. 

In a 2016 Hype Cycle for Infrastructure Protection report, Gartner analyst Jeremy D'Hoinne initiated the emerging category of Firewall as a Service (FWaaS).

He defined FWaaS as ‚Äú...a firewall delivered as a cloud-based service or hybrid solution (that is, cloud plus on-premises appliances). The promise of FWaaS is to provide simpler and more flexible architecture by leveraging centralized policy management, multiple enterprise firewall features and traffic tunneling to partially or fully move security inspections to a cloud infrastructure‚Äù
Recently, in the 2017 Magic Quadrant for Unified Threat Management (SMB Multifunction Firewalls), the analysts reference a Gartner client survey indicating 14% of respondents were likely (8%) or very likely (6%) to consider moving all the firewall security functions to FWaaS. 

FWaaS isn't merely packaging of legacy appliances into a managed service. It is challenging the decades-old concept of the appliance as the primary form factor to deliver network security capabilities. 


What is an FWaaS?
FWaaS offers a single logical firewall that is available anywhere, seamlessly scales to address any traffic workload, enforces unified policy, and self-maintained by a cloud provider.

Let‚Äôs look at these elements in more detail. 

‚Ä¢ Single, global firewall instance¬†‚Äî¬†One firewall instance for the entire global organization is radically different than the current architecture that places a network security stack at each location, a regional hub or a datacenter.

With FWaaS every organizational resource (data center, branch, cloud infrastructure or a mobile user) plugs into the FWaaS global service and leverages all of its security capabilities (application control, URL filtering, IPS, etc). 

‚Ä¢ Seamlessly scales to address inspection workload¬†‚Äî¬†FWaaS provides the necessary compute resources to perform all security processing on all traffic regardless of source or destination.

IT teams no longer need complex sizing processes to determine the appliance capacity needed to plan for today‚Äôs business requirements and future growth.

For example, the increase in SSL traffic volume pressures appliance processing capacity and can force unplanned. FWaaS can scale to accommodate these needs without disrupting the customer‚Äôs business operations.

‚Ä¢ Enforcing a unified policy¬†‚Äî¬†A single firewall, by design, has a single security policy. While legacy appliance vendors created centralized management consoles to ease managing distributed appliances, IT must still consider the individual firewalls instances per location and often customize policies to the locations‚Äô unique attributes.

In heterogenous firewall environments (often created due to M&A) security policy is hard to configure and enforce increasing exposure to hackers and web-borne threats.  Contrast that with a single cloud-based firewall that uniformly applies the security policy on all traffic, for all locations and users.

‚Ä¢ Self-maintained¬†‚Äî¬†One of the most painful aspects of firewall management is maintaining the software through patches and upgrades. It is a risky process that could impact business connectivity and security.

Many IT teams tend to skip or completely avoid software upgrades, leaving enterprise exposed. Because the cloud-based firewall software is maintained by the FWaaS provider and is shared by all customers, the firewall is kept up to date by quickly fixing vulnerabilities and bugs, and rapidly evolving with new features and capabilities that the customers can immediately access. 

FWaaS is bringing genuine relief to overburdened IT teams within enterprises and service providers. Instead of wasting cycles on sizing, deploying, patching, upgrading and configuring numerous edge devices, work can now shift to delivering true security value to the business through early detection and fast mitigation of true risk. 


FWaaS Providers
FWaaS is not a mere concept. It has been deployed in production deployments and by several vendors.

 Cato Networks is a provider of the Cato Cloud, built from the ground up to deliver Firewall as a Service.

Cato provides an optimized, global SD-WAN, ensuring resilient connectivity to its FWaaS in from all regions of the world. Cato can completely eliminate edge firewalls by inspecting both WAN and Internet-bound traffic. The Cato Cloud FWaaS further extends to mobile users and cloud datacenters. 

Zscaler provides FWaaS for Internet-bound traffic from remote branches and mobile users. To secure WAN traffic, customers must rely on other means.
<span class="highlight-match">
Palo Alto Networks </span>recently announced a similar service. It uses its next generation firewall within a cloud service to protect users, whether in remote locations or mobile, accessing the Internet. 

FWaaS is a viable alternative for IT teams that waste time and money to sustain their distributed edge firewall environments ‚Äî the so-called appliance sprawl.

With FWaaS, they can now reduce the operational and capital expense of upgrading and refreshing appliances as well as the attack surface resulting from delayed patches and unmitigated vulnerabilities.

By simplifying the network security architecture, FWaaS makes IT more productive and the business secure.

One of the most devastating aspects of the recent WannaCry ransomware attack was its self-propagating capability exploiting a vulnerability in the file access protocol, SMB v1.

Most enterprises defences are externally-facing, focused on stopping incoming email and web attacks. But, once attackers gain a foothold inside the network through malware, there are very few security controls that would prevent the spread of the attack between enterprise locations in the Wide Area Network (WAN).

This is partly due to the way enterprises deploy security tools, such as IPS appliances, and the effort needed to maintain those tools across multiple locations. 

It‚Äôs for those reasons<span class="highlight-match"> Cato Networks </span>recently introduced a context-aware Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) as part of its secure SD-WAN service. There are several highlights in this announcement that challenge the basic concept of how IT security maintains an IPS device and sustains the effectiveness of its protection.

Cato Networks is a cloud-based, SD-WAN service provider that uniquely integrates network security into its SD-WAN offering.

The Cato IPS is fully converged with Cato‚Äôs other security services, which include next generation firewall (NGFW), secure web gateway (SWG), URL filtering, and malware protection.

With the IPS roll out, Cato continues its march towards providing secure networking everywhere while simplifying the overall IT stack for the enterprise.  


Cato Networks IPS as a Service
With IPS as a service, Cato takes care of the work previously spent managing and maintaining the IPS appliances including sizing, capacity planning, patching, and signature management.

These are a complex task because IPS appliance performance is impacted by the mix of encrypted and unencrypted traffic and the number of active attack signatures.

Normally, IT professionals must spend time carefully calculating the effectiveness of a signature and its performance impact to avoid slowing-down traffic due to IPS appliance overload. 

Cato addresses both issues. The Cato IPS leverages its elastic cloud platform to inspect any mix of encrypted and unencrypted traffic in real-time.

The decision of which signatures to deploy is made by the experts of Cato Research Labs. They consider the relevancy of the threat and the best way to describe it to the system. Often, an existing signature may already cover a specific attack vector. 


New Kind of Signatures With Context-Aware Protection 


The Cato IPS has another unique capability. Because it operates in the same software stack as all other network and security services and within a cloud network, it can access a rich set of context attributes.

This forms a foundation for very sophisticated signatures that are hard to compose with stand-alone IPS devices. The use of rich context makes Cato IPS  signatures more accurate and more effective.

Context attributes include the application being accessed and the client being used to access it, user identity, geolocation, IP and domain reputation, the file type exchanged, and DNS activity associated with the session.  

Cato shared on its blog how Cato IPS stopped the spread of the Wannacry ransomware across sites, and how Cato IPS detected command-and-control communication at one of its customer locations.

Interestingly, the IPS can extend its protection across sites and users without the need to deploy distributed appliances, another benefit of the system. 

If you are a distributed enterprise and constraint by your ability to support a complex networking and security environment, Cato‚Äôs approach can improve your security posture while keeping overhead to a minimum.  

Disclosure:¬†This is a sponsored post from Cato Networks, and it is really coming at a great time because we were just thinking to share with you about how to prevent Wannacry like attacks from spreading across the enterprise networks.

Nobody likes to do router and firewall management. It often requires a lot of hard labor just keeping the infrastructure up and running.

If you ever had to set up IPsec tunnels between different firewall brands, change a firewall rule and hope nothing breaks, upgrade to the latest software or urgently patch a vulnerability ‚Äì you know what I am talking about.

All of these issues have been with us basically forever. Recently, the list of complex tasks extended to getting cloud infrastructure connected to the rest of the network, and secure access for mobile users.

There seems to be a change coming to this key part of IT, a silver lining if you will. We decided to take a look at one solution to this problem ‚Äì the Cato Cloud from<span class="highlight-match"> Cato Networks.</span>

Founded in 2015, Cato Networks provides a software-defined and cloud-based secure enterprise network that connects all locations, people and data to the Cato Cloud ‚Äì a single, global, and secure network.

Cato promises to simplify networking and security by delivering enterprise-grade network with built-in network security, instead of all the appliances and point solutions currently being used for that purpose.

We were delighted to find a fresh approach to the age-old way of managing networking and security that is really compelling, especially for short-handed IT teams.


What We Tested

We set out to transform a legacy network architecture using the Cato Cloud ("Cato"), and looked into four areas:


Provisioning: connecting sites and users to the WAN. Typically, this is a time consuming and error-prone process, especially when creating a multi-vendor firewall full mesh.
Administration: define and change access and security policies. Adding new policies and extending them to each location is a key task that requires careful planning to avoid conflicts and ensure all sites maintain compliance with the corporate security policy.
Access: connect to company resources in both on-premise and cloud data centers. Multiple data centers, and especially cloud ones, contribute to increased access fragmentation. Typically, users have to connect to each resource directly, so eliminating this requirement improves the user experience.
Security: Finally, we will test security effectiveness against Internet threats such as malicious websites and files. This is expected functionality from secure web gateways but with the added benefits of zero maintenance and elastic capacity.




Testing Environment

We wanted to simulate a typical customer environment for our testing, so we‚Äôve built a hybrid environment that includes a headquarters, remote branch, mobile user, and cloud data center.

All sites and users require access to the Internet and the data centers located in the HQ and the cloud.

For the setup, we used both physical and virtual machines. Our main office simulates the headquarters (HQ), and I‚Äôm using my home office to simulate the remote branch (Branch).

The HQ connects to the internet using a symmetrical 50/50 Mbps internet line and already has a perimeter firewall. The Branch connects to the Internet over asymmetrical 100 Mbps link and a small office firewall.

We also built two cloud data centers in Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. On both datacenters, we run Windows servers with a simple web application. The sites and data centers establish WAN connectivity over VPN.


Figure 1: Testing environment before Cato




Provisioning:
We tested Cato‚Äôs ability to provision new sites and users by using the Cato Management Application (CMA).

Our first task was to connect the HQ to Cato. Cato offers connectivity support using a standard IPsec tunnel, so we‚Äôll leverage our existing firewall to connect to Cato.

The firewall initiates the connection and configures to route all traffic to Cato. The firewall enforces no security; it is simply moving the traffic to Cato where WAN connectivity and traffic inspection will be accomplished.

Next, we connected the cloud data centers to Cato (AWS and Azure). Connecting cloud data centers is done via Cato-initiated VPN tunnels to the built-in VPN gateways in most cloud platforms.



Figure 2: Adding new cloud data center to Cato



By connecting multiple cloud data centers to Cato, you bring separate network resources (across global regions or cloud providers) into a single network. This reduces the complexity (and sometimes overcome provider limitations) on unifying data center access across all cloud resources.



Figure 3: Headquarters and cloud data centers connect to Cato with IPsec VPN



Next, we connected Branch to Cato. In this case, we will use a Cato-provided networking device called the Cato Socket. The Cato Socket simply forwards traffic to the Cato Cloud.

Per Cato, the Cato Socket can handle up to 1 Gbps traffic of any kind, WAN and the Internet, and does not require any manual updates or upgrades since it is self-managed from the cloud. The Cato Socket provisioning process is plug-and-play, and the only action required by on-site stuff is to plug it into power and an Internet connection.

Once connected, the Cato Socket automatically "calls home" and waits for the administrator to name it, in our case we chose "London," and confirm the connection into the network.

The advantage of using a Cato Socket instead of the firewall is that it eliminates the complexity of appliances: installation, updates, upgrades, and that it has no capacity limitation because no security enforcement is done on the device itself.



Figure: 4: Cato Socket automatic provisioning



Finally, we connected a mobile user to Cato. To enroll with the Cato service, the admin sends an email invitation using the CMA to the user (user information can be loaded using Active Directory integration or for testing purposes added manually).



Figure 5: VPN user invitation sent from the Cato Management Application



The user then receives an email with a link to a Cato self-service portal that would install the Cato Client and automatically configure the user‚Äôs credentials and the Cato Cloud configuration.



Figure 6: The Cato Client installation and provisioning process



When done, the user can now connect the device to the Cato Cloud and gain access to the network. Resource access is enabled according to the access and security policy, and internet browsing from the device is protected by Cato‚Äôs built-in network security services.



Figure 7: HQ, Branch, Cloud DC and Mobile Users connects to Cato





Administration:
Network and security administrators are required to change network configurations and investigate security incidents on a daily basis. In this part of the product review, we examined the day-to-day operations granularity, simplicity, and efficiency.


Access Policy Configuration:
Once all sites, cloud datacenters, and mobile users are connected to Cato, we defined a policy that sets access permissions. In Cato, the access policy is divided into two parts: Access to WAN resources and Access to the Internet.

1. The WAN firewall controls access to business resources on physical and cloud data centers.



Figure 8: WAN firewall rule that enables users and sites access to data centers



2. The Internet Firewall controls all access from the sites and from mobile devices to the internet. This is an application-aware policy at layer 7.



Figure 9: Internet access rule that blocks access to file sharing, and remote access applications



The approach Cato took in their access policy is really interesting. Access rules consolidate the resources that should be protected, and a direction arrow defines the allowed flow of traffic.

This way, instead of creating multiple rules, a single one can be used. In addition, the order of the rules isn't critical (unlike with traditional firewalls). This makes it simpler to add a new rule to the policy.


Security Policy Configuration:
Cato offers a built-in full network security stack in the cloud. The security stack includes URL Filtering and Anti-malware with TLS support. All WAN and internet traffic that route via Cato is inspected.

The Cato URL Filtering has a recommended out-of-the-box policy. URLs are organized in categories, and each category can be set to allow, block, monitor, and prompt.

For example, the admin can define all suspected phishing websites to block.



Figure 10: URL Filtering policy



The built-in Anti-malware scans both the internet and WAN traffic and can be set to block or monitor for incidents.



Figure 11: The Anti-malware scans both the internet and WAN traffic



What's unique about the Cato solution is that capacity and sizing is not a consideration for the customer. Unlike appliance-based security, there is no need to upgrade appliances when traffic volume, traffic mix or required security functions change.

With Cato, all traffic inspection is done in the cloud and scales to meet customer needs seamlessly. For example, because TLS inspection has a big impact on appliance performance, admins tend to be very careful when using it. With Cato we just enabled it, and it worked.


Connectivity:
Before using Cato, our HQ, Branch and cloud resources connected over VPN with a dedicated tunnel created for each resource. A mobile user also needed VPN to the datacenters, so they were required to connect and disconnect from the platforms‚Äô dedicated VPN gateway each time they wanted to connect to a different datacenter.

With Cato, the sites, data center, and mobile users are connected to one cloud network, so all resources are accessible with a single VPN connection. Branch tunnels into the Cato Cloud using the Cato Socket, and mobile devices tunnel using the Cato Client.



Figure 12: Cato client for iOS connects the user to all resources with a single VPN connection



We wanted to test the network traffic analytics tools Cato provides with the system. Good visibility into network activities, performance, and usage is an important piece of any networking platform.

The CMA provides full visibility into connected networks and hosts. The administrator can view the usage of each network resource, and can focus on specific network events. Throughput, packet loss, latency and usage by an application are clearly shown to the administrator.

Security:
Since the Cato Cloud replaces the firewall functionality we used and moved it to the cloud, we wanted to check its effectiveness and the visibility it offers for security incidents.

We decided to download a malicious file from the internet over SSL for our testing.

We browsed to malwr.com and searched for a real Ransomware:



Figure 14: Ransomware sample from malwr.com



We then clicked the "download" button on one of the files to download it to a computer located at Branch, behind the Cato Cloud. Cato indeed detected the attempt and blocked the download.

On the CMA we could see this security event.



Figure 15: Cato Anti-malware event on the malicious file download attempt



The Cato event directs us for more information on VirusTotal.



Figure: 16: Our Ransomware on VirusTotal



VirusTotal recognized this file as a BitcoinBlackmailer.exe which is a Ransomware file. The Cato security stack works in the cloud and inspects both internet and WAN traffic so even a malware file downloaded from one of our data centers would have been blocked.

Let's now look at Cato's application level policies and URL Filtering effectiveness. On the CMA we setup a rule to block usage of BitTorrent and Tor from Branch.



Figure 17: Application-aware Firewall policy to block Bittorrent and Tor



We installed the Tor browser and tried to connect to the Tor network. Cato‚Äôs firewall blocked the connection.



Figure 18: Cato blocks Tor



For the URL filtering test, we defined a rule to block Gambling websites.



Figure 19: URL Filtering Policy to block Gambling websites



When we tried to browse to a gambling site (from Chrome we browsed to www.888.com), Cato blocked it and redirected us to an error page.



Figure 20: Cato blocks browsing to gambling website




Conclusion:
Cato Networks promised to simplify networking and security management by moving it to the cloud. We were really impressed by the simplicity and speed of migrating an on-premise network and security infrastructure to the Cato Cloud.

The administration is easy and intuitive, and we found the end user experience to be simple for both setup and ongoing management of connectivity and security. But probably the most compelling feature is the relief Cato provides by eliminating the need to run distributed security appliances.

Cato takes care of the infrastructure for you. That is a huge benefit for busy and understaffed IT professionals.

How often does a vendor take away work, rather than layer extra work on top?

Nice work, Cato Networks.

Admit it. Who would not want their firewall maintenance grunt work to go away?

For more than 20 years, companies either managed their edge firewall appliances or had service providers rack-and-stack appliances in their data centers and did it for them.

This was called a managed firewall ‚Äî  an appliance wrapped with a managed service, often from a carrier or managed security service provider (MSSP).

The provider assumed the management of the firewall box, its software, and even its policy and management from the over-burdened IT team. But customers ended up paying for the inefficiency of dealing with appliances (i.e. ‚Äúgrunt work‚Äù) because the problem just shifted to the provider. A new architecture was needed - a transformation from an appliance form factor to a true cloud service. 

In a 2016 Hype Cycle for Infrastructure Protection report, Gartner analyst Jeremy D'Hoinne initiated the emerging category of Firewall as a Service (FWaaS).

He defined FWaaS as ‚Äú...a firewall delivered as a cloud-based service or hybrid solution (that is, cloud plus on-premises appliances). The promise of FWaaS is to provide simpler and more flexible architecture by leveraging centralized policy management, multiple enterprise firewall features and traffic tunneling to partially or fully move security inspections to a cloud infrastructure‚Äù
Recently, in the 2017 Magic Quadrant for Unified Threat Management (SMB Multifunction Firewalls), the analysts reference a Gartner client survey indicating 14% of respondents were likely (8%) or very likely (6%) to consider moving all the firewall security functions to FWaaS. 

FWaaS isn't merely packaging of legacy appliances into a managed service. It is challenging the decades-old concept of the appliance as the primary form factor to deliver network security capabilities. 


What is an FWaaS?
FWaaS offers a single logical firewall that is available anywhere, seamlessly scales to address any traffic workload, enforces unified policy, and self-maintained by a cloud provider.

Let‚Äôs look at these elements in more detail. 

‚Ä¢ Single, global firewall instance¬†‚Äî¬†One firewall instance for the entire global organization is radically different than the current architecture that places a network security stack at each location, a regional hub or a datacenter.

With FWaaS every organizational resource (data center, branch, cloud infrastructure or a mobile user) plugs into the FWaaS global service and leverages all of its security capabilities (application control, URL filtering, IPS, etc). 

‚Ä¢ Seamlessly scales to address inspection workload¬†‚Äî¬†FWaaS provides the necessary compute resources to perform all security processing on all traffic regardless of source or destination.

IT teams no longer need complex sizing processes to determine the appliance capacity needed to plan for today‚Äôs business requirements and future growth.

For example, the increase in SSL traffic volume pressures appliance processing capacity and can force unplanned. FWaaS can scale to accommodate these needs without disrupting the customer‚Äôs business operations.

‚Ä¢ Enforcing a unified policy¬†‚Äî¬†A single firewall, by design, has a single security policy. While legacy appliance vendors created centralized management consoles to ease managing distributed appliances, IT must still consider the individual firewalls instances per location and often customize policies to the locations‚Äô unique attributes.

In heterogenous firewall environments (often created due to M&A) security policy is hard to configure and enforce increasing exposure to hackers and web-borne threats.  Contrast that with a single cloud-based firewall that uniformly applies the security policy on all traffic, for all locations and users.

‚Ä¢ Self-maintained¬†‚Äî¬†One of the most painful aspects of firewall management is maintaining the software through patches and upgrades. It is a risky process that could impact business connectivity and security.

Many IT teams tend to skip or completely avoid software upgrades, leaving enterprise exposed. Because the cloud-based firewall software is maintained by the FWaaS provider and is shared by all customers, the firewall is kept up to date by quickly fixing vulnerabilities and bugs, and rapidly evolving with new features and capabilities that the customers can immediately access. 

FWaaS is bringing genuine relief to overburdened IT teams within enterprises and service providers. Instead of wasting cycles on sizing, deploying, patching, upgrading and configuring numerous edge devices, work can now shift to delivering true security value to the business through early detection and fast mitigation of true risk. 


FWaaS Providers
FWaaS is not a mere concept. It has been deployed in production deployments and by several vendors.

<span class="highlight-match"> Cato Networks </span>is a provider of the Cato Cloud, built from the ground up to deliver Firewall as a Service.

Cato provides an optimized, global SD-WAN, ensuring resilient connectivity to its FWaaS in from all regions of the world. Cato can completely eliminate edge firewalls by inspecting both WAN and Internet-bound traffic. The Cato Cloud FWaaS further extends to mobile users and cloud datacenters. 

Zscaler provides FWaaS for Internet-bound traffic from remote branches and mobile users. To secure WAN traffic, customers must rely on other means.

Palo Alto Networks recently announced a similar service. It uses its next generation firewall within a cloud service to protect users, whether in remote locations or mobile, accessing the Internet. 

FWaaS is a viable alternative for IT teams that waste time and money to sustain their distributed edge firewall environments ‚Äî the so-called appliance sprawl.

With FWaaS, they can now reduce the operational and capital expense of upgrading and refreshing appliances as well as the attack surface resulting from delayed patches and unmitigated vulnerabilities.

By simplifying the network security architecture, FWaaS makes IT more productive and the business secure.

A massive malicious email campaign that stems from the Necurs botnet is spreading a new ransomware at the rate of 5 million emails per hour and hitting computers across the globe.

Dubbed "Jaff," the new file-encrypting ransomware is very similar to the infamous Locky ransomware in many ways, but it is demanding 1.79 Bitcoins (approx $3,150), which much higher than Locky, to unlock the encrypted files on an infected computer.

According to security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Forcepoint </span>Security Lab, Jaff ransomware, written in C programming language, is being distributed with the help of Necurs botnet that currently controls over 6 million infected computers worldwide.

Necurs botnet is sending emails to millions of users with an attached PDF document, which if clicked, opens up an embedded Word document with a malicious macro script to downloads and execute the Jaff ransomware, Malwarebytes says.


Jaff is Spreading at the Rate of 5 Million per Hour


The malicious email campaign started on Thursday morning at 9 am and had peaked by 1 pm, and its system recorded and blocked more than 13 million emails during that period ‚Äì that's 5 Million emails per an hour.

"Jaff targets 423 file extensions. It is capable of offline encryption without dependency on a command and control server. Once a file is encrypted, the '.jaff' file extension is appended," Forcepoint says.
The ransomware then drops a ransom note in every affected folder while the desktop background of the infected computer is also replaced.

The ransom note tells victims that their files are encrypted, but doesn‚Äôt ask them for any payments; instead, it urges victims to visit a payment portal located on a Tor site, which is accessible via Tor Browser, in order to get decrypt their important files.

Once victims install Tor Browser and visit the secret site, there they are then asked for an astounding 1.79 BTC (about $3,150).


Separate research conducted by Proofpoint researchers indicated that the Jaff ransomware could be the work of the same cybercriminal gang behind Locky, Dridex, and Bart.

The security company said that the Raff ransomware campaign had affected users globally with primarily victim organizations in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Mexico and Australia.


Massive Ransomware Attack Uses NSA's Windows Exploit

In separate news, another massive fast-spreading ransomware campaign is targeting computers at Hospitals, Banks, Telecom and Organisations across the globe today.

The ransomware, known as WanaCypt0r or WannaCry, is using NSA's Windows exploit, EternalBlue, which was leaked by Shadow Brokers hacking group over a month ago.

Within just hours this cyber attack has infected more than 60,000 computers in 74 countries.


How can you Protect yourself from the Jaff Ransomware?

To safeguard against such ransomware infection, you should always be suspicious of uninvited documents sent an email and should never click on links inside those documents unless verifying the source.

Check if macros are disabled in your Microsoft Office applications. If not, block macros from running in Office files from the Internet. In enterprises, your system admin can set the default setting for macros.

To always have a tight grip on all your important files and documents, keep a good backup routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that is not always connected to your PC.

Moreover, make sure that you run an active anti-virus security suite of tools on your system, and most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

Carbanak ‚Äì One of the most successful cybercriminal gangs ever that's known for the theft of one billion dollars from over 100 banks across 30 countries back in 2015 ‚Äì is back with a BANG!

The Carbanak cyber gang has been found abusing various Google services to issue command and control (C&C) communications for monitoring and controlling the machines of unsuspecting malware victims.
<span class="highlight-match">
Forcepoint </span>Security Labs researchers said Tuesday that while investigating an active exploit sent in phishing messages as an RTF attachment, they discovered that the Carbanak group has been hiding in plain site by using Google services for command and control.

"The Carbanak actors continue to look for stealth techniques to evade detection," Forcepoint's senior security researcher Nicholas Griffin said in a blog post. "Using Google as an independent C&C channel is likely to be more successful than using newly created domains or domains with no reputation."
The RTF document features an embedded OLE object that contains a VBScript (Visual Basic Script), which is previously associated with the Carbanak malware, and uses social engineering to trick victims into clicking on an envelope image to "unlock the contents."


It turns out that the envelope image actually hides the embedded OLE object, so as soon as the victim double-clicks that picture, a dialog box opens asking if the victim wants to run the file unprotected.vbe.

If the victim runs the file, Carbanak's VBScript malware will get executed, and, according to Forcepoint, the malware will "send and receive commands to and from Google Apps Script, Google Sheets, and Google Forms services."

Besides VBScript malware, Forcepoint researchers also discovered a new 'ggldr' script module encoded inside the main VBScript file along with various other VBScript modules, capable of using Google services as a command and control channel.

"The ‚Äòggldr‚Äô script will send and receive commands to and from Google Apps Script, Google Sheets, and Google Forms services," "For each infected user a unique Google Sheets spreadsheet is dynamically created to manage each victim," Griffin said.

"The use of a legitimate third party service like this one gives the attacker the ability to hide in plain sight. It is unlikely that these hosted Google services are blocked by default in an organization, so it is more likely that the attacker will establish a C&C channel successfully."
Forcepoint researchers reckon it is probable that the hacking group is using Google services because these services are allowed by default at many companies and organizations, which makes it easier for hackers to exfiltrate data and send instructions.

Carbanak, also known as Anunak, is one of the most successful cybercriminal operations in the world and is a highly organized group that continually evolves its tactics to carry out cyber crime while avoiding detection by potential targets and the authorities.

The group was first exposed in 2015 as financially-motivated cybercriminals targeting mainly financial institutions. Since it started operating in 2013, Carbanak has stolen upwards of $1 Billion from more than 100 banks across the globe.

Forcepoint has already notified Google of the issue, and its researchers are working with the web technology giant on this particular abuse of its legitimate web services.

DDoS has become a game now that could knock any service offline.

A Turkish hacking group is encouraging individuals to join its DDoS-for-Points platform that features points and prizes for carrying out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against a list of predetermined targets.

The points earned can later be redeemed for various online click-fraud and hacking tools.

Dubbed Sath-ƒ± M√ºdafaa, translated as Surface Defense in English, this DDoS-for-Points platform is advertised via local Turkish hacking forums, including Turkhackteam and Root Developer.

Surface Defense prompts other hackers in Turkey to sign up and asks them to attack political websites using a DDoS tool known as Balyoz, translated as Sledgehammer.

According to<span class="highlight-match"> Forcepoint </span>security researchers, who discovered this program, Balyoz works via Tor and requires a username and password to log in. The tool then uses a DoS technique to flood targets with traffic.


Here's How the Balyoz Tool Works


Once a user downloads the Surface Defense collaboration software from hacking forums and registers, the program then runs locally on a computer, prompting the user to download DDoS attack tool in order to assault the limited list of target sites.

The DDoS traffic is then routed through Tor to disrupt online services. For every 10 minutes the tool attack a website with fraudulent traffic, the participant receives a point.

The points can then be used to obtain rewards including a more powerful version of the Balyoz DDoS attacking tool, "click-fraud" bots that automatically clicks on ads for pay-to-click (PTC) services like Ojooo and Neobux PTC to generate revenue, and a program that has ability to infect PCs and scare the victim with images and sounds.


The DDoS Tool Contains Hidden Backdoor

The DDoS platform software also contains a hidden backdoor that allows the Surface Defense operator to "hack the hackers," raising concerns over the operator's actual motives.

"The backdoor is a very small Trojan and its sole purpose is to download, extract and execute another .NET assembly from within a bitmap image," Forcepoint researchers said.¬†

"It also downloads a secondary 'guard' component which it installs as a service. This 'guard' component ensures that if the backdoor is deleted then it will be re-downloaded and also installed as a service."
The list of predefined targets includes Kurdish websites of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), its military wing the People's Defense Force (HPG), an organization by NATO members, Kurdish radio and TV stations, Kurdish hacking crews, and more.

Other politically-motivated targets include the Armenian Genocide website, the German Christian Democratic Party -- which is led by Angela Merkel -- and many Israeli websites.

"Users can also suggest new websites to add to the list of targets," Forcepoint researchers said. "There is a live scoreboard for participants to see how they compare to other participants."
The researchers have managed to track down the IP address of the Surface Defense software, despite running on the Dark Web through Tor.

This development helped researchers gathered some information on the hacker's identity, like the operator might act under the handle "Mehmet," runs two YouTube channels advertising the Balyoz DDoS tool, and the operator is possibly based in the Turkish city of Eskisehir.

For more technical details on the Surface Defense platform, you can head on to the Forcepoint's 30-page research paper [PDF] titled, "Sledgehammer - Gamification of DDoS attacks (for ideology, profit & mischief)."

Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment as it takes a monstrous amount of computing power, and thus hackers have started using malware that steals computing resources of computers it hijacks to make lots of dollars in digital currency.

Security researchers at security firm ESET have spotted one such malware that infected hundreds of Windows web servers with a malicious cryptocurrency miner and helped cybercriminals made more than $63,000 worth of Monero (XMR) in just three months.

According to a report published by ESET today, cybercriminals only made modifications to legitimate open source Monero mining software and exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft IIS 6.0 to secretly install the miner on unpatched Windows servers.

Although ESET's investigation does not identify the attackers, it reports that the attackers have been infecting unpatched Windows web servers with the cryptocurrency miner since at least May 2017 to mine 'Monero,' a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency.

The vulnerability (CVE-2017-7269) exploited by the attackers was discovered in March 2017 by Zhiniang Peng and Chen Wu and resides in the WebDAV service of Microsoft IIS version 6.0‚Äîthe web server in Windows Server 2003 R2.

Therefore, hackers are only targeting unpatched machines running Windows Server 2003 to make them part of a botnet, which has already helped them made over $63,000 worth of Monero.



Since the vulnerability is on a web server, which is meant to be visible from the internet, it can be accessed and exploited by anyone. You can learn more about the vulnerability here.

The newly discovered malware mines Monero that has a total market valuation of about $1.4 billion, which is far behind Bitcoin in market capitalisation, but cybercriminals‚Äô love for Monero is due to its focus on privacy.

Unlike Bitcoin, Monero offers untraceable transactions and is anonymous cryptocurrency in the world today.

Another reason of hackers favouring Monero is that it uses a proof-of-work algorithm called CryptoNight, which suits computer or server CPUs and GPUs, while Bitcoin mining requires specific mining hardware.

However, this is not the first time when analysts have spotted such malware mining Monero by stealing computing resources of compromised computers.

In mid-May, Proofpoint researcher Kafeine discovered cryptocurrency mining malware, called 'Adylkuzz,' which was using EternalBlue exploit‚Äîcreated by the NSA and dumped last month by the Shadow Brokers in April‚Äîto infect unpatched Windows systems to mine Monero.

A week before that,<span class="highlight-match"> GuardiCore </span>researchers discovered a new botnet malware, dubbed BondNet, that was also infecting Windows systems, with a combination of techniques, for primarily mining Monero.

A new botnet consisting of more than 15,000 compromised servers has been used to mine various cryptocurrencies, earning its master around $25,000 per month.

Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment, as it requires an enormous amount of computing power, but cybercriminals have found an easy money-making solution.

Dubbed BondNet, the botnet was first spotted in December 2016 by<span class="highlight-match"> GuardiCore </span>researchers, who traced back the botnet malware developer, using online handle Bond007.01, to China.

According to the GuardiCore researchers, Bond007.01 is currently using BondNet for mining cryptocurrencies ‚Äî primarily Monero, but also ByteCoin, RieCoin, and ZCash ‚Äî but they warn that the hacker could easily take full control of compromised servers for malicious purposes, like mounting Mirai-style DDoS attacks.




BondNet Attacks only Windows Server Machines

Since mining cryptocurrencies require large amounts of CPU/GPU power, the botnet master goes after Windows Server machines; instead of consumer IoT devices.

However, in order to compromise Windows Server machines, the botnet master relies on different attack techniques. Researchers say the hacker uses a combination of old vulnerabilities and weak user/password combinations to attack mostly old and unsupported Windows Server machines.

The most common flaws exploited by the botnet operator include known phpMyAdmin configuration flaws, exploits in JBoss, and bugs in Oracle Web Application Testing Suite, MSSQL servers, ElasticSearch, Apache Tomcat, Oracle Weblogic, and other services.

Once the hacker gain access to a Windows Server machine, he deploys Visual Basic files to gather information about the infected system and then install a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and a cryptocurrency miner to make a huge profit from the hacked servers.




BondNet's Botnet Infrastructure

One thing that's worth noticing is that the botnet operator does not use all infected machines for mining cryptocurrencies. The operator has built its botnet infrastructure of compromised servers with various roles:

1. Some infected machines serve as scanning servers to check for vulnerable systems on the Internet by going through a list of IP addresses with open ports that have been compiled with the WinEggDrop TCP port scanner.

2. Some servers are used as file servers to host the mining software.

3.¬†Other infected servers are turned into command-and-control (C&C) servers after they have been equipped with a fork of goup ‚Äî a small open source HTTP server written in Golang.

"Building an attack infrastructure on top of victim machines helps conceal the attacker‚Äôs true identity and origin of the attack," the GuardiCore researchers explained in their report published Thursday.¬†

"It also provides high availability infrastructure, which is very helpful when relying on compromised servers, providing infinite backup options in case one of the servers fails or loses connectivity to the internet."
BondNet has already infected more than 15,000 server machines at major institutions around the world, including high-profile global companies, universities, and city councils, while the majority of them runs Windows Server 2008 R2.

Additionally, the BondNet botnet adds around 500 new machines to its network each day, and an approximately the same number of servers are delisted.


Here's How to Detect the Threat and How to Mitigate:

To prevent your machines from getting hacked, server admins are advised to secure their systems by regularly applying security patches for all software, updating the firmware, and employing stronger passwords.

Meanwhile, GuardiCore has also provided network and file indicators of compromise systems to help server administrators check whether their machines are among compromised ones.

The researchers have also released a detection & cleanup tool (registration is required to download it) to help admins find and remove BondNet bots from their servers, as well as instructions on how to clean the system manually, without using the script.

A security researcher has just discovered a stealthy cryptocurrency-mining malware that was also using Windows SMB vulnerability at least two weeks before the outbreak of WannaCry ransomware attacks.

According to Kafeine, a security researcher at Proofpoint, another group of cyber criminals was using the same EternalBlue exploit, created by the NSA and dumped last month by the Shadow Brokers, to infect hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide with a cryptocurrency mining malware called 'Adylkuzz.'

This malicious campaign went unnoticed for weeks because unlike WannaCry, this malware does not install ransomware or notify victims, but instead, it quietly infects unpatched computers with malware that only mine 'Monero,' a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency.


This Malware Saves Computers From Getting Hacked By WannaCry

The Researcher believes Adylkuzz malware attack could be larger in scale than WannaCry ransomware attack because it has been designed to block SMB ports of a targeted computer after hijacking it.

In other words, Adylkuzz malware infects unpatched computers and then closes SMB ports to prevent them from further infections, which may have indirectly saved hundreds of thousand of computers from getting hacked by WannaCry ransomware as well.

Mining cryptocurrencies can be a costly investment as it requires an enormous amount of computing power, but the Adylkuzz cryptocurrency-mining malware makes it easier for cybercriminals by allowing them to utilize computing resources of compromised systems and makes lots and lots of dollars.

"Once infected through use of the EternalBlue exploit, the cryptocurrency miner Adylkuzz is installed and used to generate cybercash for the attackers," said Robert Holmes, vice president of products at Proofpoint.
One Monero is currently valued at around US$26.77.

"While an individual laptop may generate only a few dollars per week, collectively the network of compromised computers appears to be generating five-figure payouts daily," the researchers added.
According to Proofpoint, tens of thousands of computers across the world have been infected by the Adylkuzz malware.

Despite people's efforts to patch their systems to prevent themselves from the WannaCry menace, Proofpoint believes the Adylkuzz attack is still growing and targeting Windows machines.

Last week, in a separate research,<span class="highlight-match"> GuardiCore </span>researchers uncovered a new botnet malware, dubbed BondNet, that was also infecting Windows machines worldwide, with a combination of techniques, for mining cryptocurrencies ‚Äî primarily Monero, but also ByteCoin, RieCoin, and ZCash.

If this isn't enough, you'll find yourself worry after knowing that the hacking group, Shadow Brokers, who last month leaked the Windows SMB exploit, is back, promising to release more zero-days¬†vulnerabilities and exploits starting from June.

So, the best key to keeping yourself safe is that instead of worrying about your devices, just patch them with the latest updates and follow some basic security tips that I have mentioned in my previous article about how to disable SMB and prevent your machines from WannaCry, cryptocurrency mining malware, and other malware.

The company that sells digital forensics and mobile hacking tools to others has itself been hacked.

Israeli firm<span class="highlight-match"> Cellebrite,</span> the popular company that provides digital forensics tools and software to help law enforcement access mobile phones in investigations, has had 900 GB of its data stolen by an unknown hacker.

But the hacker has not yet publicly released anything from the stolen data archive, which includes its customer information, user databases, and a massive amount of technical data regarding its hacking tools and products.

Instead, attackers are looking for possible opportunities to sell the access to Cellebrite system and data on a few selected IRC chat rooms, the hacker told Joseph Cox, contributor at Motherboard, who was contacted by the hacker and received a copy of the stolen data.

Meanwhile, Cellebrite also admitted that it recently experienced "unauthorized access to an external web server," and said that it is "conducting an investigation to determine the extent of the breach. The impacted server included a legacy database backup of my.Cellebrite, the company's end user license management system."

The 900 GB of stolen archive also includes login data (usernames and passwords) of Cellebrite customers, which suggests that it has been taken from the web servers related to Cellebrite's site.

The dump also contains "evidence files from seized mobile phones, and logs from Cellebrite devices," as well as it appears that company has sold phone hacking tools to repressive regimes, such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia.

On the other hand, the hacker did not clearly state the actual extent of what he/she had done to Cellebrite's systems.

"I can't say too much about what has been done," the hacker told Motherboard. "It's one thing to slap them, it's a very different thing to take pictures of [their] balls hanging out."
Cellebrite is known for its powerful hacking tool Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED) that help investigators bypass the security mechanisms of mobile phones, especially iPhones, and extract all data, including SMS messages, emails, call logs and passwords from them.

Just a few months back, Cellebrite's most sensitive in-house capabilities were made public by one of its products' resellers, who distributed copies of Cellebrite's firmware and software for anyone to download.

The Israeli firm<span class="highlight-match"> Cellebrite,</span> which provides digital forensics tools and software to help law enforcement access mobile phones in investigations, has had its firmware and software leaked online.

Yes, you heard that right. Cellebrite's most sensitive in-house capabilities have been made public by one of its products' resellers, who is now distributing copies of Cellebrite's firmware and software for anyone to download.

The apparent reseller is McSira Professional Solutions, which hosts software for various versions of Cellebrite's Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED).

UFED is one of the company's key products that help investigators bypass the security mechanisms of mobile phones, especially iPhones, and extract all data and passwords from them.

For the Cellebrite's hand on iOS devices, you can watch the 2015 YouTube video (below), which demonstrates one of the company's products that unlocked the iPhone device in few hours.


Download¬†Links to¬†Cellebrite's Key Forensic Product¬†

McSira is allowing anyone to download the firmware for the UFED Touch and UFED 4PC (PC version). The company is also hosting copies of UFED packages for different mobile phone brands, including Apple, Samsung, Blackberry, Nokia, and LG.

Besides this, McSira is also hosting copies of Cellebrite forensic software, such as the UFED Phone Detective, UFED Cloud Analyzer and Link Analyzer, which allows investigators to analyze seized data further.

McSira is likely offering these download links for firmware and software files so that its customers ‚Äì which, according to its site, are "police, military and security agencies in the E.U. and other parts of the world" ‚Äì can conveniently update their hardware to the latest version.




However, the company opened doors for researchers, hackers, and its competitors to download these leaked files, reverse-engineer them, and figure out how Cellebrite's tools break into mobile phones.


Researcher Started Examining leaked Software and Firmware

According to Joseph Cox, freelance security journalist for Motherboard, an unnamed researcher has already started examining the leaked files to disclose the kind of exploits Cellebrite uses to bypass even strong security mechanisms on mobile phones, as well as weaknesses in the implementation of affected phones that could be fixed.

Another researcher Pedro Vila√ßa from SentinelOne said he already cracked some of the Cellebrite software and ran it against an old iPad, though he said he needed to explore the leaked files more to understand the capability of those software better.


"Doesn't seem to be trying to exploit things but just data extraction," Vila√ßa told Motherboard. "For example, I'd to pair my device with iTunes for the logical extraction feature to work."

Mike Reilly, a PR firm representative that works with Cellebrite, said the McSira website's links "don't allow access to any of the solutions without a license key," meaning that downloaders need a key (code) given by Cellebrite or its reseller to run those software.

At the time of writing, McSira is hosting these files, but it is not clear how long the files will be hosted on its website.

McSira and Cellebrite have yet to comment on the matter.

	      Apple Weakens iOS 10 Backup Encryption; Now Can Be Cracked 2,500 Times Faster [1.05 Points on average]

After the iPhone encryption battle between Apple and the FBI, Apple was inspired to work toward making an unhackable future iPhones by implementing stronger security measures even the company can't hack.

Even at that point the company hired one of the key developers of Signal ‚Äî one of the world's most secure, encrypted messaging apps ‚Äî its core security team to achieve this goal.

But it seems like Apple has¬†taken something of a backward step.


Apple deliberately weakens Backup Encryption For iOS 10

With the latest update of its iPhone operating system, it seems the company might have made a big blunder that directly affects its users' security and privacy.

Apple has downgraded the hashing algorithm for iOS 10 from "PBKDF2 SHA-1 with 10,000 iterations" to "plain SHA256 with a single iteration," potentially allowing attackers to brute-force the password via a standard desktop computer processor.

PBKDF2 stands for Password-Based Key Derivation Function, is a key stretching algorithm which uses a SHA-1 hash with thousands of password iterations, which makes password cracking quite difficult.

In iOS 9 and prior versions back to iOS 4, PBKDF2 function generates the final crypto key using a pseudorandom function (PRF) 10,000 times (password iterations), which dramatically increases authentication process time and makes dictionary or brute-force attacks less effective.


Now Bruteforce 2,500 times Faster than earlier iOS Versions

Moscow-based Russian firm ElcomSoft, who discovered this weakness that is centered around local password-protected iTunes backups, pointed out that Apple has betrayed its users by deliberately downgrading its 6 years old effective encryption to SHA256 with just one iteration.

Therefore, a hacker only requires to try a single password once and brute force to find a match and crack the account login, making the entire process substantially less time consuming.

"We discovered an alternative password verification mechanism added to iOS 10 backups. We looked into it and found out that the new mechanism skips certain security checks, allowing us to try passwords approximately 2500 times faster compared to the old mechanism used in iOS 9 and older," Oleg Afonin from Elcomsoft wrote in a blog post today.
Yes, that's right. With iOS 10, it's possible for an attacker to brute force the password for a user‚Äôs local backup 2,500 faster than was possible on iOS 9, using a computer with an Intel Core i5 CPU (with 6 million passwords per second).

However, an obvious limitation to this attack is that it can't be performed remotely.

Since the weakness is specific to password-protected local backups on iOS 10, a hacker would require access to your device‚Äôs local backup, where the iPhone files are stored.

Elcomsoft is a well-known Russian forensics company that, like market leader<span class="highlight-match"> Cellebrite,</span> makes money by selling a kit that can hack into iPhones for the purpose of rooting around a target's device.

The Elcomsoft's kit was believed to have been used in The Fappening (or 'Celebgate') hack, where hackers exposed celebrities' nude pictures in 2014 by hacking into the Apple iCloud and Gmail accounts of more than 300 victims.

The group of unknown hackers who hijacked CCleaner's download server to distribute a malicious version of the popular system optimization software targeted at least 20 major international technology companies with a second-stage payload.

Earlier this week, when the CCleaner hack was reported, researchers assured users that there's no second stage malware used in the massive attack and affected users can simply update their version in order to get rid of the malicious software.

However, during the analysis of the hackers' command-and-control (C2) server to which the malicious CCleaner versions connected, security researchers from Cisco's Talos Group found evidence of a second payload (GeeSetup_x86.dll, a lightweight backdoor module) that was delivered to a specific list of computers based on local domain names.


Affected Technology Firms¬†

According to a predefined list mentioned in the configuration of the C2 server, the attack was designed to find computers inside the networks of the major technology firms and deliver the secondary payload. The target companies included:

Google
Microsoft
Cisco
Intel
Samsung
Sony
HTC
Linksys
D-Link
Akamai<span class="highlight-match">
VMware
</span>
In the database, researchers found a list of nearly 700,000 backdoored machines infected with the malicious version of CCleaner, i.e. the first-stage payload, and a list of at least 20 machines that were infected with the secondary payload to get a deeper foothold on those systems.

The CCleaner hackers specifically chose these 20 machines based upon their Domain name, IP address, and Hostname. The researchers believe the secondary malware was likely intended for industrial espionage.


CCleaner Malware Links to Chinese Hacking Group

According to the researchers from Kaspersky, the CCleaner malware shares some code with the hacking tools used by a sophisticated Chinese hacking group called Axiom, also known as APT17, Group 72, DeputyDog, Tailgater Team, Hidden Lynx or AuroraPanda.

"The malware injected into #CCleaner has shared code with several tools used by one of the APT groups from the #Axiom APT 'umbrella'," tweeted director of Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky Lab.
Cisco researchers also note that one configuration file on the attacker's server was set for China's time zone, which suggests China could be the source of the CCleaner attack. However, this evidence alone is not enough for attribution.

Cisco Talos researchers also said that they have already notified the affected tech companies about a possible breach.


Removing Malicious CCleaner Version would Not Help

Just removing the Avast's software application from the infected machines would not be enough to get rid of the CCleaner second stage malware payload from their network, with the attackers' still-active C2 server.

So, affected companies that have had their computers infected with the malicious version of CCleaner are strongly recommended to fully restore their systems from backup versions before the installation of the tainted security program.

"These findings also support and reinforce our previous recommendation that those impacted by this supply chain attack should not simply remove the affected version of CCleaner or update to the latest version, but should restore from backups or reimage systems to ensure that they completely remove not only the backdoored version of CCleaner but also any other malware that may be resident on the system," the researchers say.
For those who are unaware, the Windows 32-bit version of CCleaner v5.33.6162 and CCleaner Cloud v1.07.3191 were affected by the malware, and affected users should update the software to version 5.34 or higher.

How much does your privacy cost?

It will soon be sold for half a Million US dollars.

A controversial company specialises in acquiring and reselling zero-day exploits is ready to pay up to US$500,000 for working zero-day vulnerabilities targeting popular secure messenger applications, such as Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp.

Zerodium announced a new pricing structure on Wednesday, paying out $500,000 for fully functional remote code execution (RCE) and local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerabilities in Signal, WhatsApp, iMessage, Viber, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, and Telegram.

The payouts for all these secure messengers have been increased after tech companies introduced end-to-end encryption in their apps, making it more difficult for anyone to compromise their messaging platforms.

The same payout is offered for remote code execution and local privilege escalation security flaws in default mobile email applications.

Launched in 2015, Zerodium is a Washington, DC-based premium exploit acquisition platform by the infamous French-based company Vupen that buys and sells zero-day exploits to government agencies around the world.

The maximum bounty offered by the company remains for Apple's iOS devices with $1.5 million offered to anyone who can pull off a remote jailbreak of iOS devices without any user interaction, and $1 million for those that require user interaction.


This payout was set last year when Zerodium raised the price for a remote iOS 10 jailbreaks from $1 Million to $1.5 Million, which is more than seven times what Apple is offering (up to $200,000) for iOS zero-days via its bug bounty program.


Zerodium Zero-Day Hit-list:

Zerodium's payout for other new exploit categories for servers and desktop computers include:

Up to $300,000 for a Windows 10 exploit that requires no user interaction
Up to $150,000 for Apache Web Server
Up to $100,000 for Microsoft Outlook
Up to $80,000 for Mozilla Thunderbird
Up to $80,000 for<span class="highlight-match"> VMware </span>escapes
Up to $30,000 for USB code execution

Zerodium has also raised the prices the company will pay for a range of other exploits, which include:

Chrome RCE and LPE for Windows‚Äîfrom $80,000 to $150,000
PHP Web programming language RCE‚Äîfrom $50,000 to $100,000
RCE in OpenSSL crypto library used to implement TLS‚Äîfrom $50,000 to $100,000
Microsoft Exchange Server RCE‚Äîfrom $40,000 to $100,000
RCE and LPE in the TOR version of Firefox for Linux‚Äîfrom $30,000 to $100,000
RCE and LPE in the TOR version of Firefox for Windows‚Äîfrom $30,000 to $80,000

The zero-day market has long been a lucrative business for private firms that regularly offer more payouts for undisclosed security vulnerabilities than big technology companies.

Hackers will get the payout within a week of submitting the zero-day vulnerabilities along with a working proof-of-concept, though we recommend you to submit them to the affected vendors because it's a matter of time when some black hat finds and uses them against you and wide audience.

The brand new Android smartphone launched by Google just a few months back has been hacked by Chinese hackers just in less than a minute.

Yes, the Google's latest Pixel smartphone has been hacked by a team white-hat hackers from Qihoo 360, besides at the 2016 PwnFest hacking competition in Seoul.

The Qihoo 360 team demonstrated a proof-of-concept exploit that used a zero-day vulnerability in order to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the target smartphone.

The exploit then launched the Google Play Store on the Pixel smartphone before opening Google Chrome and displaying a web page that read "Pwned By 360 Alpha Team," the Reg media reports.

Qihoo 360 won $120,000 cash prize for hacking the Pixel.


Google will now work to patch the vulnerability.

Besides the Google Pixel, Microsoft Edge running under Windows 10 was also hacked in PwnFest hacking competition. 

The Qihoo 360 team also hacked Adobe Flash with a combination of a decade-old, use-after-free zero-day vulnerability and a win32k kernel flaw to win a $120k prize.

Along with hacker JH, Chinese iPhone jailbreak team Pangu, which release million-dollar iOS jailbreaks for free, discovered a Safari exploit that used a privilege escalation zero-day flaw, giving them root access on Apple's updated Safari browser running on MacOS Sierra in just 20 seconds.

The exploit earned the team $80,000.


Hackers Compromised Microsoft Edge is just 18 seconds


Researchers from Qihoo 360 and South Korean security researcher Junghoon Lee, aka LokiHardt, completely hacked the Microsoft Edge web browser operating on Windows 10 Red Stone 1 in just 18 seconds.

The security experts gained SYSTEM-level remote code execution on Edge, although they denied disclosing details of the vulnerability until the affected vendors come with a fix. Both researchers earned $140,000 for their Edge exploit.

Another Qihoo hacker team and Lee both, for the first time, remotely compromised<span class="highlight-match"> VMware </span>Workstation 12.5.1 without user interaction, bagging $150,000 for their exploits.

Details of all the exploits will be reported to the respected companies so that they can patch their software before black-hat hackers use them for malicious purposes.

The Qihoo 360 team of hackers walked away with a total prize money of $520,000.

Sensitive files linked to the United States intelligence agency were reportedly left on a public Amazon server by one of the nation's top intelligence contractor without a password, according to a new report.

UpGuard cyber risk analyst Chris Vickery discovered¬†a cache of 60,000 documents from a US military project for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) left unsecured on Amazon cloud storage server for anyone to access.

The documents included passwords to a US government system containing sensitive information, and the security credentials of a senior employee of<span class="highlight-match"> Booz Allen </span>Hamilton, one of the country's top defense contractors.

Although there wasn't any top secret file in the cache Vickery discovered, the documents included credentials to log into code repositories that could contain classified files and other credentials.

Roughly 28GB of exposed documents included the private Secure Shell (SSH) keys of a Booz Allen employee, and a half dozen plain text passwords belonging to government contractors with Top Secret Facility Clearance, Gizmodo reports.

What's more? The exposed data even contained master credentials granting administrative access to a highly-protected Pentagon system.

The sensitive files have since been secured and were likely hidden from those who didn't know where to look for them, but anyone, like Vickery, who knew where to look could have downloaded those sensitive files, potentially allowing access to both highly classified Pentagon material and Booz Allen information.

"In short, information that would ordinarily require a Top Secret-level security clearance from the DoD was accessible to anyone looking in the right place; no hacking was required to gain credentials needed for potentially accessing materials of a high classification level," Vickery says.
Vickery is reputed and responsible researcher, who has previously tracked down a number of exposed datasets on the Internet. Two months ago, he discovered an unsecured and publicly exposed database, containing nearly 1.4 Billion user records, linked to River City Media (RCM).

Vickery is the one who, in 2015, reported a huge cache of more than 191 Million US voter records¬†and details of nearly 13 Million MacKeeper users.


Both NGA and¬†Booz Allen are Investigating the Blunder

The NGA is now investigating this security blunder.

"We immediately revoked the affected credentials when we first learned of the potential vulnerability," the NGA said in a statement. "NGA assesses its cyber security protections and procedures constantly with all of its industry partners. For an incident such as this, we will closely evaluate the situation before determining an appropriate course of action."
However, Booz Allen said the company is continuing with a detailed forensic investigation about the misstep.

"Booz Allen takes any allegation of a data breach very seriously, and promptly began an investigation into the accessibility of certain security keys in a cloud environment," a Booz Allen spokesperson told Gizmodo.¬†

"We secured those keys, and are continuing with a detailed forensic investigation. As of now, we have found no evidence that any classified information has been compromised as a result of this matter."
Booz Allen Hamilton is the same consulting firm that employed whistleblower Edward Snowden when he disclosed the global surveillance conducted by the NSA. It is among top 100 US federal contractor and once described as "the world‚Äôs most profitable spy organisation."

Almost two months ago, the FBI quietly arrested NSA contractor Harold Thomas Martin III for stealing an enormous number of top secret documents from the intelligence agency.

Now, according to a court document filed Thursday, the FBI seized at least 50 terabytes of data from 51-year-old Martin that he siphoned from government computers over two decades.

The stolen data that are at least 500 million pages of government records includes top-secret information about "national defense." If all data stolen by Martin found indeed classified, it would be the largest NSA heist, far bigger than Edward Snowden leaks.

According to the new filing, Martin also took "six full bankers‚Äô boxes" worth of documents, many of which were marked "Secret" and "Top Secret." The stolen data also include the personal information of government employees. The stolen documents date from between 1996 through 2016.
"The document appears to have been printed by the Defendant from an official government account," the court documents read. "On the back of the document are handwritten notes describing the NSA's classified computer infrastructure and detailed descriptions of classified technical operations."
Former NSA Insider Could Be Behind The Shadow Brokers
It's not clear exactly what Martin allegedly stole, but The New York Times reported Wednesday that the stolen documents also included the NSA's top secret hacking tools posted online by a supposed hacking group, calling itself Shadow Brokers, earlier this year.

Earlier this summer, Shadow Brokers claimed to have infiltrated NSA servers and stolen enormous amounts of data, including working exploits and hacking tools. 

The NY Times report suggests that the FBI has found forensic evidence that the hacking tools and cyber-weapons posted online by the alleged hacking group had actually been on a contractor's machine.

NSA Contractor to Face Espionage Charges
Martin, a former<span class="highlight-match"> Booz Allen </span>Hamilton staffer like NSA whistleblower Snowden, should remain locked up and the government also plans to charge him with violations of the Espionage Act, Prosecutors said.

If convicted, one can face the death penalty.

Martin has "obtained advanced educational degrees" and has also "taken extensive government training courses on computer security," including in the areas of encryption as well as secure communications.

A former US Navy veteran, Martin allegedly used a sophisticated software that "runs without being installed on a computer system and provides anonymous Internet access, leaving no digital footprint on the Machine." 

It's believed that Martin was using¬†TAILS operating system or another USB-bootable operating system in conjunction with Tor or a VPN that would not leave any forensic evidence of his computer activities.

Martin's motives are still unclear, but among the seized documents, investigators uncovered a letter sent to Martin's colleagues in 2007, in which he criticized the information security practices of government and refers to those same co-workers as "clowns."
The letter reads: "I will leave you with this: if you do not get obnoxious, obvious, and detrimental to my future, then I will not bring you; into the light, as it were. If you do, well, remember that you did it to yourselves."Martin is due to appear before US Magistrate Judge Beth P. Gesner for his detention hearing on Friday in Baltimore.

Another Edward Snowden?

The FBI has secretly busted another National Security Agency (NSA) contractor over a massive secret data theft.

The United States Justice Department charged Harold Thomas Martin, 51, with theft of highly classified government material, including "source codes" developed by the NSA to hack foreign government, according to a court complaint (PDF) unsealed on Wednesday.

According to the DoJ's chief national security prosecutor John Carlin, Martin was employed by<span class="highlight-match"> Booz Allen </span>Hamilton, the same consulting firm that employed whistleblower Edward J. Snowden when he disclosed the global surveillance conducted by the NSA.

Currently, the FBI is investigating whether Martin stole and leaked highly classified computer source codes developed to hack into the networks of Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and other United States adversaries, the New York Times reports.

If stolen, this would be the second time in last 3 years when someone with access to secret data was able to swipe NSA's classified information.

Now hiding out in Russian embassy, Snowden responded to the arrest on Twitter, saying: "This is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products?"

Martin was arrested after a search of his home, garage, and vehicle in Glen Burnie, Maryland on August 27, according to the indictment.

"A large percentage of the materials recovered from Martin's residence and vehicle bore markings indicating that they were the property of the United States and contained highly classified information of the United States," FBI Special Agent Jeremy Bucalo writes.
The indictment also says feds found both digital as well as hard copy material that clearly marked as highly classified documents and property of the US government. 

If convicted, Martin faces up to 10 years in prison.

Own an Android smartphone? Beware, as just an innocuous-looking image on social media or messaging app could compromise your smartphone.

Along with the dangerous Quadrooter vulnerabilities that affected 900 Million devices and other previously disclosed issues, Google has patched a previously-unknown critical bug that could let attackers deliver their hack hidden inside an innocent looking image via social media or chat apps.

In fact, there is no need for a victim to click on the malicious photo because as soon as the image‚Äôs data was parsed by the phone, it would quietly allow a remote attacker to take control over the device or simply crash it.

The vulnerability is similar to last year's Stagefright bug (exploit code) that allowed hackers to hijack Android devices with just a simple text message without the owners being aware of it. 

The Stagefright flaw affected more than 950 Million Android devices and resided in the core Android component Stagefright ‚Äî a multimedia playback library used by Android to process, record and play multimedia files.

However, the recent vulnerability (CVE-2016-3862) resided in the way images used by certain Android applications parsed the Exif data in an image,<span class="highlight-match"> SentinelOne'</span>s Tim Strazzere, the researcher who uncovered the vulnerability, told Forbes. 

Any app using Android's Java object ExifInterface code is likely vulnerable to the issue.


An Image Received...? Your Game is Over

Making a victim open the image file within an affected app like Gchat or Gmail, a hacker could either cause a victim's phone to crash or remotely execute malicious code to inject malware on the phone and take control of it without victim‚Äôs knowledge.

"Since the bug is triggered without much user interaction ‚Äì an application only needs to load an image a specific way ‚Äì triggering the bug is as simple as receiving a message or email from someone," Strazzere said. "Once that application attempts to parse the image (which was done automatically), the crash is triggered."
According to Strazzere, attackers could develop a simple exploit inside an image to target a large number of vulnerable Android devices.

Strazzere crafted exploits for the affected devices and found that it worked on Gchat, Gmail and most other messenger and social media apps, though he did not disclose the names of the other non-Google apps affected by the flaw.


When will I expect a Fix?

All versions of Google's operating system from Android 4.4.4 to 6.0.1 are vulnerable to the image-based hack, except today's update that fixed the vulnerability.

The researcher even successfully tested his exploits on a handful of phones running Android 4.2 and Amazon devices and found that the devices remain unpatched, leaving a large number of users of older Android devices exposed. 

So, if you are not running an updated version of operating system and/or device, you probably are vulnerable to the image-based attack. 

Google has delivered a patch to fix the issue, but given the shaky history of handset manufacturers and carriers rolling out security patches, it is not known how long the companies will take to update vulnerable Android devices.

Google rewarded Strazzere with $4,000 as part of the company‚Äôs Android bug bounty program and another $4,000 as, Forbes reports; Strazzere had pledged to give all his reward money to Girls Garage, a program and workspace for girls aged 9-13.

The Israeli firm Cellebrite, which provides digital forensics tools and software to help law enforcement access mobile phones in investigations, has had its firmware and software leaked online.

Yes, you heard that right. Cellebrite's most sensitive in-house capabilities have been made public by one of its products' resellers, who is now distributing copies of Cellebrite's firmware and software for anyone to download.

The apparent reseller is McSira Professional Solutions, which hosts software for various versions of Cellebrite's Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED).

UFED is one of the company's key products that help investigators bypass the security mechanisms of mobile phones, especially iPhones, and extract all data and passwords from them.

For the Cellebrite's hand on iOS devices, you can watch the 2015 YouTube video (below), which demonstrates one of the company's products that unlocked the iPhone device in few hours.


Download¬†Links to¬†Cellebrite's Key Forensic Product¬†

McSira is allowing anyone to download the firmware for the UFED Touch and UFED 4PC (PC version). The company is also hosting copies of UFED packages for different mobile phone brands, including Apple, Samsung, Blackberry, Nokia, and LG.

Besides this, McSira is also hosting copies of Cellebrite forensic software, such as the UFED Phone Detective, UFED Cloud Analyzer and Link Analyzer, which allows investigators to analyze seized data further.

McSira is likely offering these download links for firmware and software files so that its customers ‚Äì which, according to its site, are "police, military and security agencies in the E.U. and other parts of the world" ‚Äì can conveniently update their hardware to the latest version.




However, the company opened doors for researchers, hackers, and its competitors to download these leaked files, reverse-engineer them, and figure out how Cellebrite's tools break into mobile phones.


Researcher Started Examining leaked Software and Firmware

According to Joseph Cox, freelance security journalist for Motherboard, an unnamed researcher has already started examining the leaked files to disclose the kind of exploits Cellebrite uses to bypass even strong security mechanisms on mobile phones, as well as weaknesses in the implementation of affected phones that could be fixed.

Another researcher Pedro Vila√ßa from<span class="highlight-match"> SentinelOne </span>said he already cracked some of the Cellebrite software and ran it against an old iPad, though he said he needed to explore the leaked files more to understand the capability of those software better.


"Doesn't seem to be trying to exploit things but just data extraction," Vila√ßa told Motherboard. "For example, I'd to pair my device with iTunes for the logical extraction feature to work."

Mike Reilly, a PR firm representative that works with Cellebrite, said the McSira website's links "don't allow access to any of the solutions without a license key," meaning that downloaders need a key (code) given by Cellebrite or its reseller to run those software.

At the time of writing, McSira is hosting these files, but it is not clear how long the files will be hosted on its website.

McSira and Cellebrite have yet to comment on the matter.

"Disable macros and always be extra careful when you manually enable it while opening Microsoft Office Word documents."

You might have heard of above-mentioned security warning multiple times on the Internet as hackers usually leverage this decade old macros-based hacking technique to hack computers through specially crafted Microsoft Office files, particularly Word, attached to spam emails.

But a new social engineering attack has been discovered in the wild, which doesn't require users to enable macros; instead it executes malware on a targeted system using PowerShell commands embedded inside a PowerPoint (PPT) file.

Moreover, the malicious PowerShell code hidden inside the document triggers as soon as the victim moves/hovers a mouse over a link (as shown), which downloads an additional payload on the compromised machine -- even without clicking it.

Researchers at Security firm<span class="highlight-match"> SentinelOne </span>have discovered that a group of hackers is using malicious PowerPoint files to distribute 'Zusy,' a banking Trojan, also known as 'Tinba' (Tiny Banker).

Discovered in 2012, Zusy is a banking trojan that targets financial websites and has the ability to sniff network traffic and perform Man-in-The-Browser attacks in order to inject additional forms into legit banking sites, asking victims to share more crucial data such as credit card numbers, TANs, and authentication tokens.

"A new variant of a malware called 'Zusy' has been found in the wild spreading as a PowerPoint file attached to spam emails with titles like 'Purchase Order #130527' and 'Confirmation.' It's interesting because it doesn't require the user to enable macros to execute," researchers at SentinelOne Labs say in a blog post.
The PowerPoint files have been distributed through spam emails with subjects like "Purchase Order" and "Confirmation," which when opened, displays the text "Loading...Please Wait" as a hyperlink.


When a user hovers the mouse over the link it automatically tries to trigger the PowerShell code, but the Protected View security feature that comes enabled by default in most supported versions of Office, including Office 2013 and Office 2010, displays a severe warning and prompts them to enable or disable the content.

If the user neglects this warning and allows the content to be viewed, the malicious program will connect to the "cccn.nl" domain name, from where it downloads and executes a file, which is eventually responsible for the delivery of a new variant of the banking Trojan called Zusy.

"Users might still somehow enable external programs because they're lazy, in a hurry, or they're only used to blocking macros," SentinelOne Labs says. "Also, some configurations may possibly be more permissive in executing external programs than they are with macros."
Another security researcher, Ruben Daniel Dodge, also analyzed this new attack and confirmed that this newly discovered attack does not rely on Macros, Javascript or VBA for the execution method.

"This is accomplished by an element definition for a hover action. This hover action is setup to execute a program in PowerPoint once the user mouses over the text. In the resources definition of slide1 'rID2' is defined as a hyperlink where the target is a PowerShell command," Dodge said.
The security firm also said that the attack doesn't work if the malicious file is opened in PowerPoint Viewer, which refuses to execute the program. But the technique could still be efficient in some cases.

Security researchers have discovered a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the popular Apache Struts web application framework, allowing a remote attacker to run malicious code on the affected servers.

Apache Struts is a free, open-source, Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language, which supports REST, AJAX, and JSON.

The vulnerability (CVE-2017-9805) is a programming blunder that resides in the way Struts processes data from an untrusted source. Specifically, Struts REST plugin fails to handle XML payloads while deserializing them properly.

All versions of Apache Struts since 2008 (Struts 2.1.2 - Struts 2.3.33, Struts 2.5 - Struts 2.5.12) are affected, leaving all web applications using the framework‚Äôs REST plugin vulnerable to remote attackers.

According to one of the security researchers at LGTM, who discovered this flaw, the Struts framework is being used by "an incredibly large number and variety of organisations," including<span class="highlight-match"> Lockheed Martin,</span> Vodafone, Virgin Atlantic, and the IRS.

"On top of that, [the vulnerability] is incredibly easy for an attacker to exploit this weakness: all you need is a web browser," Man Yue Mo, an LGTM security researcher said.

All an attacker needs is to submit a malicious XML code in a particular format to trigger the vulnerability on the targeted server.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to take full control of the affected server, eventually letting the attacker infiltrate into other systems on the same network.

Mo said this flaw is an unsafe deserialization in Java similar to a vulnerability in Apache Commons Collections, discovered by Chris Frohoff and Gabriel Lawrence in 2015 that also allowed arbitrary code execution.

Many Java applications have since been affected by multiple similar vulnerabilities in recent years.

Since this vulnerability has been patched in Struts version 2.5.13, administrators are strongly advised to upgrade their Apache Struts installation as soon as possible.

More technical details about the vulnerability and proof-of-concept have not been published by the researchers yet, giving admins enough time to upgrade their systems.

The massive Equifax data breach that exposed highly sensitive data of as many as 143 million people was caused by exploiting a flaw in Apache Struts framework, which Apache patched over two months earlier of the security incident, Equifax has confirmed.

Credit rating agency Equifax is yet another example of the companies that became victims of massive cyber attacks due to not patching a critical vulnerability on time, for which patches were already issued by the respected companies.

Rated critical with a maximum 10.0 score, the Apache Struts2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) exploited in the Equifax breach was disclosed and fixed by Apache on March 6 with the release of Apache Struts version 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1.

This flaw is separate from CVE-2017-9805, another Apache Struts2 vulnerability that was patched earlier this month, which was a programming bug that manifests due to the way Struts REST plugin handles XML payloads while deserializing them, and was¬†fixed in Struts version 2.5.13.

Right after the disclosure of the vulnerability, hackers started actively exploiting the flaw in the wild to install rogue applications on affected web servers after its proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code was uploaded to a Chinese site.

Despite patches were made available and proofs that the flaw was already under mass attack by hackers, Equifax failed to patched its Web applications against the flaw, which resulted in the breach of personal data of nearly half of the US population.

"Equifax has been intensely investigating the scope of the intrusion with the assistance of a leading, independent cyber security firm to determine what information was accessed and who have been impacted," the company officials wrote in an update on the website with a new "A Progress Update for Consumers."¬†

"We know that criminals exploited a US website application vulnerability. The vulnerability was Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638. We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation, and have shared indicators of compromise with law enforcement."
CVE-2017-5638 was a then-zero-day vulnerability discovered in the popular Apache Struts web application framework by Cisco's Threat intelligence firm Talos, which observed a number of active attacks exploiting the flaw.

The issue was a remote code execution bug in the Jakarta Multipart parser of Apache Struts2 that could allow an attacker to execute malicious commands on the server when uploading files based on the parser.

At the time, Apache warned it was possible to perform a remote code execution attack with "a malicious Content-Type value," and if this value is not valid "an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user."

For those unaware, Apache Struts is a free, open-source MVC framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language that run both front-end and back-end Web servers. The framework is used by 65n per cent of the Fortune 100 companies, including<span class="highlight-match"> Lockheed Martin,</span> Vodafone, Virgin Atlantic, and the IRS.

Since the hackers are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities in the Apache Struts web framework, Cisco has also initiated an investigation into its products against four newly discovered security vulnerabilities in Apache Struts2.

Other companies that also incorporate a version of Apache Struts 2 should¬†also check their infrastructures against these vulnerabilities.

Equifax is currently offering free credit-monitoring and identity theft protection services for people who are affected by the massive data leak and has also enabled a security freeze for access to people's information.

While the company was initially criticised for generating a PIN that was simply a time and date stamp and easy-to-guess, the PIN generation method was later changed to randomly generate numbers.

Some of Cisco products including its Digital Media Manager, MXE 3500 Series Media Experience Engines, Network Performance Analysis, Hosted Collaboration Solution for Contact Center, and Unified Contact Center Enterprise¬†have¬†been¬†found vulnerable to multiple Apache Struts flaws.


Cisco Launches Apache Struts Vulnerability Hunting

Cisco is also testing rest of its products against four newly discovered security vulnerability in Apache Struts2, including the one (CVE-2017-9805) we reported on September 5 and the remaining three also disclosed last week.

However, the remote code execution bug (CVE-2017-5638) that was actively exploited back in March this year is not included by the company in its recent security audit.

The three vulnerabilities‚ÄîCVE-2017-9793, CVE-2017-9804 and CVE-2017-9805‚Äîincluded in the Cisco security audit was released by the Apache Software Foundation on 5th September with the release of Apache Struts 2.5.13 which patched the issues.

The fourth vulnerability (CVE-2017-12611) that is being investigated by Cisco was released on 7th September with the release of Apache Struts 2.3.34 that fixed the flaw that resided in the Freemarker tag functionality of the Apache Struts2 package and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute malicious code on an affected system.


Apache Struts Flaw Actively Exploited to Hack Servers & Deliver Malware

Coming on to the most severe of all, CVE-2017-9805 (assigned as critical) is a programming bug that manifests due to the way Struts REST plugin handles XML payloads while deserializing them.

This could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution on a host running a vulnerable version of Apache Struts2, and Cisco's Threat intelligence firm Talos has¬†observed¬†that this flaw is¬†under active exploitation¬†to find vulnerable servers.

Security researchers from data centre security vendor Imperva recently detected and blocked thousands of attacks attempting to exploit this Apache Struts2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-9805), with roughly 80 percent of them tried to deliver a malicious payload.

The majority of attacks originated from China with a single Chinese IP address registered to a Chinese e-commerce company sending out more than 40% of all the requests. Attacks also came from Australia, the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Russia and various parts of Europe.

Out of the two remaining flaws, one (CVE-2017-9793) is again a vulnerability in the REST plug-in for Apache Struts that manifests due to "insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the XStream library in the REST plug-in for the affected application."

This flaw has been given a Medium severity and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on targeted systems.

The last flaw (CVE-2017-9804) also allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system but resides in the URLValidator feature of Apache Struts.

Cisco is testing its products against these vulnerabilities including its WebEx Meetings Server, the Data Center Network Manager, Identity Services Engine (ISE), MXE 3500 Series Media Experience Engines, several Cisco Prime products, some products for voice and unified communications, as well as video and streaming services.

At the current, there are no software patches to address the vulnerabilities in Cisco products, but the company promised to release updates for affected software which will soon be accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool.

Since the framework is being widely used by a majority of top 100 fortune companies, they should also check their infrastructures against these vulnerabilities that incorporate a version of Apache Struts2.

A 7-year-old critical remote code execution vulnerability has been discovered in Samba networking software that could allow a remote attacker to take control of an affected Linux and Unix machines.

Samba is open-source software (re-implementation of SMB networking protocol) that runs on the majority of operating systems available today, including Windows, Linux, UNIX, IBM System 390, and OpenVMS.

Samba allows non-Windows operating systems, like GNU/Linux or Mac OS X, to share network shared folders, files, and printers with Windows operating system.

The newly discovered remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) affects all versions newer than Samba 3.5.0 that was released on March 1, 2010.

"All versions of Samba from 3.5.0 onwards are vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability, allowing a malicious client to upload a shared library to a writable share, and then cause the server to load and execute it," Samba wrote in an advisory published Wednesday.


Linux version of EternalBlue Exploit?


According to the Shodan computer search engine, more than 485,000 Samba-enabled computers exposed port 445 on the Internet, and according to researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Rapid7,</span> more than 104,000 internet-exposed endpoints appeared to be running vulnerable versions of Samba, out of which 92,000 are running unsupported versions of Samba.

Since Samba is the SMB protocol implemented on Linux and UNIX systems, so some experts are saying it is "Linux version of EternalBlue," used by the WannaCry ransomware.

...or should I say¬†SambaCry?

Keeping in mind the number of vulnerable systems and ease of exploiting this vulnerability, the Samba flaw could be exploited at large scale with wormable capabilities.

Home networks with network-attached storage (NAS) devices could also be vulnerable to this flaw.


Exploit Code Released! (Bonus: Metasploit Module)


The flaw actually resided in the way Samba handled shared libraries. A remote attacker could use this Samba arbitrary module loading vulnerability (POC code) to upload a shared library to a writable share and then cause the server to load and execute malicious code.

The vulnerability is hell easy to exploit. Just one line of code is required to execute malicious code on the affected system.

simple.create_pipe("/path/to/target.so")
However, the Samba exploit has already been ported to Metasploit, a penetration testing framework, enabling researchers as well as hackers to exploit this flaw easily.


Patch and Mitigations

The maintainers of Samba has already patched the issue in their new versions Samba versions 4.6.4/4.5.10/4.4.14, and are urging those using a vulnerable version of Samba to install the patch as soon as possible.

But if you can not upgrade to the latest versions of Samba immediately, you can work around the vulnerability by adding the following line to your Samba configuration file smb.conf:

nt pipe support = no
Once added, restart the network's SMB daemon (smbd) and you are done. This change will prevent clients from fully accessing some network machines, as well as disable some expected functions for connected Windows systems.

While Linux distribution vendors, including Red Hat and Ubuntu, have already released patched versions for its users,¬†the larger risk is that from NAS device consumers that might not be updated as quickly.

Craig Williams of Cisco said that given the fact that most NAS devices run Samba and have very valuable data, the vulnerability "has potential to be the first large-scale Linux ransomware worm."

Update:¬†Samba maintainers have also provided patches for older and unsupported versions of Samba.

Meanwhile, Netgear released a security advisory for CVE-2017-7494, saying a large number of its routers and NAS product models are affected by the flaw because they use Samba version 3.5.0 or later.

However, the company currently released firmware fixes for only ReadyNAS products running OS 6.x.

	      This ATM Hack Allows Crooks to Steal Money From Chip-and-Pin Cards [1.09 Points on average]

Forget about security! It turns out that the Chip-and-PIN cards are just as easy to clone as magnetic stripe cards.

It took researchers just a simple chip and pin hack to withdraw up to $50,000 in cash from an ATM in America in under 15 minutes.

We have been told that EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) chip-equipped cards provides an extra layer of security which makes these cards more secure and harder to clone than the old magnetic stripe cards.

But, it turns out to be just a myth.

A team of security engineers from<span class="highlight-match"> Rapid7 </span>at Black Hat USA 2016 conference in Las Vegas demonstrated how a small and simple modifications to equipment would be enough for attackers to bypass the Chip-and-PIN protections and enable unauthorized transactions.

The demonstration was part of their presentation titled, "Hacking Next-Gen ATMs: From Capture to Washout," [PDF]. The team of researchers was able to show the audience an ATM spitting out hundreds of dollars in cash.


Here's How the Hack Work

The hack requires two processes to be performed.

First, the criminals need to add a small device known as a Shimmer to a point-of-sale (POS) machine (here, ATM's card reader) in order to pull off a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack against an ATM.

The shimmer sits between the victim's chip and the card reader in the ATM and can record the data on the chip, including PIN, as the ATM reads it. It then transmits this data to the criminals.

The criminals then use a smartphone to download this stolen data and recreate the victim's card in an ATM, instructing it to eject cash constantly.

Tod Beardsley, a security research manager for Rapid7, told the BBC that shimmer is basically a tiny RaspBerry-Pi-powered device that could be installed quickly to the outside of the ATM without access to the internals of the cash machine.

"It's really just a card that is capable of impersonating a chip," Beardsley said. "It's not cloning."
The perpetrators would only be able to replicate each card for a few minutes and use it to fraudulently withdraw money, enabling them to make between up to $50,000, but Beardsley suggests that a network of hacked chip-and-pin machines could create a constant stream of victims.

Researchers have disclosed full details about the issue in Chip-and-PIN ATMs to banks and major ATM manufacturers and said they hope the institutions (currently unnamed) are examining the issue.

	      New Apache Struts Zero-Day Vulnerability Being Exploited in the Wild [1.0 Points on average]

Security researchers have discovered a Zero-Day vulnerability in the popular Apache Struts web application framework, which is being actively exploited in the wild.

Apache Struts is a free, open-source, Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for creating elegant, modern Java web applications, which supports REST, AJAX, and JSON.

In a blog post published Monday, Cisco's Threat intelligence firm Talos announced the team observed a number of active attacks against the zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) in Apache Struts.

According to the researchers, the issue is a remote code execution vulnerability in the Jakarta Multipart parser of Apache Struts that could allow an attacker to execute malicious commands on the server when uploading files based on the parser.

"It is possible to perform an RCE attack with a malicious Content-Type value," warned Apache. "If the Content-Type value isn't valid an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user."
The vulnerability, documented at<span class="highlight-match"> Rapid7'</span>s Metasploit Framework GitHub site, has been patched by Apache. So, if you are using the Jakarta-based file upload Multipart parser under Apache Struts 2, you are advised to upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1 immediately.


Exploit Code Publicly Released

Since the Talos researchers detected public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code (which was uploaded to a Chinese site), the vulnerability is quite dangerous.

The researchers even detected "a high number of exploitation events," the majority of which seem to be leveraging the publicly released PoC that is being used to run various malicious commands.


In some cases, the attackers executed simple "whoami" commands to see if the target system is vulnerable, while in others, the malicious attacks turned off firewall processes on the target and dropped payloads.




"Final steps include downloading a malicious payload from a web server and execution of said payload," the researchers say. "The payloads have varied but include an IRC bouncer, a DoS bot, and a sample related to the Bill Gates botnet... A payload is downloaded and executed from a privileged account."
Attackers also attempted to gain persistence on infected hosts by adding a binary to the boot-up routine.

According to the researchers, the attackers tried to copy the file to a benign directory and ensure "that both the executable runs and that the firewall service will be disabled when the system boots."

Both Cisco and Apache researchers urge administrators to upgrade their systems to Apache Struts version 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1 as soon as possible. Admins can also switch to a different implementation of the Multipart parser.

A Russian computer hacker arrested over the weekend in Barcelona was apparently detained for his role in a massive computer botnet, and not for last year's US presidential election hack as reported by the Russian media.

Peter Yuryevich Levashov, 32-years-old Russian computer programmer, suspected of operating the Kelihos botnet ‚Äî a global network of over 100,000 infected computers that was used to deliver spam, steal login passwords, and infect computers with ransomware and other types of malware since approximately 2010, the U.S. Justice Department announced Monday.

As suspected earlier, Levashov, also known as Peter Severa, is the same man who has also been listed in the World's Top 10 Worst Spammers maintained by anti-spam group Spamhaus, which has given him the 7th position in the list.

The arrest was made possible after the FBI learned just last month that Levashov was traveling with his family to Spain from his home in Russia, a country without any extradition treaty to the United States.

Initially, it was believed that Levashov was detained on suspicion of 2016 US election hack, after his wife told Russian publication RT that authorities said her husband‚Äôs apprehension was in part due to his involvement in the U.S. election hacking, including the notorious breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

However, the DoJ press release indicates no link between Levashov and US election hack at all.

Instead, Levashov was linked to the Kelihos botnet by the FBI because he used the same IP address to operate the botnet that he used to access his email and other online accounts in his name, including Apple iCloud and Google Gmail accounts.

According to the indictment unsealed Monday, Levashov operated the botnet since 2010, targeting Microsoft Windows machines for infection. He allegedly used Kelihos to distribute hundreds of millions of spam emails per year, and pump-and-dump stock scams.

Besides conducting spamming operations, prosecutors also alleged Levashov also used the Kelihos botnet to infect end-user computers with malware and harvest passwords to online and bank accounts belonging to thousands of Americans.

"The ability of botnets like Kelihos to be weaponized quickly for vast and varied types of harms is a dangerous and deep threat to all Americans, driving at the core of how we communicate, network, earn a living, and live our everyday lives," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Blanco.


"Our success in disrupting the Kelihos botnet was the result of strong cooperation between private industry experts and law enforcement, and the use of innovative legal and technical tactics."
The FBI officials obtained court orders (Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure) to redirect Kelihos-infected PCs to servers operated by authorities ‚Äî a process known as "Sinkhole attack" ‚Äî and to block any attempts by the botnet to regain control of those sinkholed computers.

The FBI said it worked with security firm<span class="highlight-match"> CrowdStrike </span>and Shadowserver Foundation, a volunteer group of information security experts, to deploy the sinkhole attack to disconnect communications between criminals and infected computers.

Levashov has been charged with wire fraud and unauthorized interception of electronic communications. The government is now seeking his extradition to the United States.

Just a few hours after Donald Trump won the 2016 US Presidential Election, a hacking group launched a wave of cyber attacks targeting U.S.-based policy think-tanks with a new spear phishing campaign designed to fool victims into installing malware.

The group of nation-state hackers, also known as Cozy Bear, APT29, and CozyDuke, is the one of those involved in the recent data breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and is allegedly tied to the Russian government.

On Wednesday, the hackers sent a series of phishing emails to dozens of targets associated with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), policy think tanks in the US and even inside the US government, said security firm Volexity.


Phishing Attacks Powered by 'PowerDuke' Malware


The phishing emails were sent from purpose-built Gmail accounts and other compromised email accounts at Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), trying to trick victims into opening tainted attachments containing malware and clicking on malicious links.

Once this was done, the phishing e-mail dropped a new variant of Backdoor malware, dubbed "PowerDuke," giving attackers remote access to the compromised systems.

PowerDuke is an extremely sophisticated piece of malware in both its way of infecting people as well as concealing its presence.

Besides making use of wide variety of approaches, PowerDuke uses steganography to hide its backdoor code in PNG files.

The firm spotted and reported at least five waves of phishing attacks targeting people who work for organizations, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the RAND Corporation, the Atlantic Council, and the State Department, among others.

"Three of the five attack waves contained links to download files from domains that the attackers appear to have control over," the firm said in a blog post. "The other two attacks contained documents with malicious macros embedded within them. Each of these different attack waves was slightly different from one another."


Beware of Post-Election Themed Phishing Emails


All the phishing emails were election-themed. Why?

After Trump won the US presidential election, half of America, as well as people across the world, mourning the result was curious to know about the victory of Trump.

People even started searching on Google: How did Donald Trump win the US presidential election?, Were the election flawed? Why did Hillary Clinton lose?

Hackers took advantage of this curiosity to target victims, especially those who worked with the United States government and were much more concerned about Trump's victory.

Two of the emails claimed to have come from the Clinton Foundation giving insight of the elections, two others purported to be documents pertaining to the election's outcome being revised or rigged, and the last one offered a link to a PDF download on 'Why American Elections Are Flawed.'

The emails were sent using the real email address of a professor at Harvard, which indicates that the hackers likely hacked the professor's email and then used his account to send out the phishing emails.

The emails either contained malicious links to .ZIP files or included malicious Windows shortcut files linked to a "clean" Rich Text Format document and a PowerShell script.

Once clicked, the script installed PowerDuke on a victim's computer that could allow attackers to examine and control the target system. The malware has the capability to secretly download additional malicious files and evade detection from antivirus products.

Security firm<span class="highlight-match"> CrowdStrike </span>claimed in June 2016 that the hacking team Cozy Bear has previously hacked into networks belonging to the White House, State Department, and the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff.

There's a lot more to come from the DNC Hack.

The Associated Press confirmed yesterday that the computer systems used by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign were hacked as part of the recent Democratic National Convention (DNC) hack.

Last week's email dump containing almost 20,000 emails from top DNC officials was just the beginning, which led DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign as the group‚Äôs leader, as WikiLeaks announced that it was part one of its new Hillary Leaks series.

This suggests WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange has had his hands on more data from the DNC hack that, according to him, could eventually result in the arrest of Hillary Clinton.


Assange ‚Äî Wikileaks' Next Leak will lead to Arrest of Hillary Clinton

In an interview with Robert Preston of ITV last month, Assange made it clear that he hopes to harm Hillary Clinton‚Äôs chances from becoming president of the United States, opposing her candidacy on both policies as well as personal grounds.

Assange also stressed that he had "a lot more material" about Clinton's presidential campaign that could possibly provide enough evidence for the indictment of Hillary Clinton.

Now, when it has been reported that the computer systems used by Clinton's presidential campaign were breached as part of the DNC hack, one could guess this could be the next release in the Hillary Leaks series by Assange.

According to federal law enforcement officials and some cybersecurity experts, the DNC hack is believed to be an attempt by the Russian intelligence services to influence the presidential election.

U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly concluded that the Russian government was behind the theft of the DNC emails and documents. Although, it's unclear whether the attack was fairly routine espionage or an effort to manipulate the presidential election.


DNC Hack Malware Based Upon Chinese Open-Source Tool

Even, security firm<span class="highlight-match"> CrowdStrike,</span> who first investigated the DNC hack, said that the group that hacked into the DNC servers in April 2016 was engaged in extensive political and economic espionage to benefit Russian government and closely linked to the Russia's powerful and highly capable intelligence services.

According to the firm, the Fancy Bear APT (also known as APT28 and Pawn Storm) used a piece of malware called X-Tunnel to steal data from the system without getting detected.

Most recently, security firm Invincea also released its own report, saying X-Tunnel was used to steal the data from the DNC servers, but since the malware appeared to be a repurposed open source tool from a Chinese company, the firm did not support or refute "the Russian origins of the XTunnel binary."

The F.B.I. said in a statement that it "is aware of media reporting on cyber intrusions involving multiple political entities, and is working to determine the accuracy, nature, and scope of these matters."


Democratic Party Hack Influences the Presidential Election

We still have to accept the fact that someone is attacking America's computer systems in an attempt to influence the presidential election.

So this kind of politically motivated attack can become even worse in November ‚Äî at the time of voting.

Security expert Bruce Schneier stressed that since Clinton's computer systems can be targeted as part of DNC attack, it is possible that America's election systems and voting machines could also be vulnerable to a similar attack.

"We need to secure our election systems before autumn," says Schneier via the Washington Post. "If Putin's government has already used a cyber attack to attempt to help Trump win, there's no reason to believe he won't do it again ‚Äî especially now that Trump is inviting the "help.""
Since more and more states have moved to electronic voting machines and Internet voting over the past years, it has made a way for hackers to manipulate these systems.

Schneier suggests the government to "create tiger teams to test the machines‚Äô and systems‚Äô resistance to attack, drastically increase their cyber-defenses" and if can not guarantee their security online, take them offline.

A bug in Linux kernel that was discovered two years ago, but was not considered a security threat at that time, has now been recognised as a potential local privilege escalation flaw.

Identified as CVE-2017-1000253, the bug was initially discovered by Google researcher Michael Davidson in April 2015.

Since it was not recognised as a serious bug at that time, the patch for this kernel flaw was not backported to long-term Linux distributions in kernel 3.10.77.

However, researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Qualys </span>Research Labs has now found that this vulnerability could be exploited to escalate privileges and it affects all major Linux distributions, including Red Hat, Debian, and CentOS.

The vulnerability left "all versions of CentOS 7 before 1708 (released on September 13, 2017), all versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 before 7.4 (released on August 1, 2017), and all versions of CentOS 6 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 are exploitable," Qualys said in an advisory published yesterday.

The vulnerability, which has been given a CVSS3 Base Score of 7.8 out of 10, resides in the way Linux kernel loads ELF executables, which potentially results in memory corruption.

Researchers find that an unprivileged local user with access to SUID (or otherwise privileged) Position Independent Executable (PIE) binary could use this vulnerability to escalate their privileges on the affected system.

In order to mitigate this issue, users can switch to the legacy mmap layout by setting vm.legacy_va_layout to 1, which will effectively disable the exploitation of this security flaw.

Since the mmap allocations start much lower in the process address space and follow the bottom-up allocation model, "the initial PIE executable mapping is far from the reserved stack area and cannot interfere with the stack."

Qualys says this flaw is not limited to the PIEs whose read-write segment is larger than 128MB, which is the minimum distance between the mmap_base and the highest address of the stack, not the lowest address of the stack.

So, when passing 1.5GB of argument strings to execve(), any PIE can be mapped directly below the stack and trigger the vulnerability.

Linux distributions, including Red Hat, Debian, and CentOS, have released security updates to address the vulnerability.

The Qualys team has promised to publish a proof-of-concept soon exploit that works on CentOS-7 kernel versions "3.10.0-514.21.2.el7.x86_64" and "3.10.0-514.26.1.el7.x86_64," once a maximum number of users have had time to patch their systems against the flaw.

A high-severity vulnerability has been reported in Linux that could be exploited by a low privilege attacker to gain full root access on an affected system.

The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2017-1000367, was discovered by researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Qualys </span>Security in Sudo's "get_process_ttyname()" function for Linux that could allow a user with Sudo privileges to run commands as root or elevate privileges to root.

Sudo, stands for "superuser do!," is a program for Linux and UNIX operating systems that lets standard users run specific commands as a superuser (aka root user), such as adding users or performing system updates.

The flaw actually resides in the way Sudo parsed "tty" information from the process status file in the proc filesystem.

On Linux machines, sudo parses the /proc/[pid]/stat file in order to determine the device number of the process's tty from field 7 (tty_nr), Qualys Security explains in its advisory.

Although the fields in the file are space-delimited, it is possible for field 2 (the command name) to include whitespace (including newline), which sudo doesn't account for.

Therefore, a local user with sudo privileges (Sudoer) on SELinux-enabled systems can cause sudo to use a device number of his choice "by creating a symbolic link from the sudo binary to a name that contains a space, followed by a number," escalating their privileges to overwrite any file on the filesystem, including root-owned files.
"To exploit the bug, the user can choose a device number that does not currently exist under /dev. If sudo does not find the terminal under the /dev/pts directory, it performs a breadth-first search of /dev...The attacker may then create a symbolic link to the newly-created device in a world-writable directory under /dev, such as /dev/shm," an alert on the sudo project website reads.¬†"This file will be used as the command's standard input, output and error when an SELinux role is specified on the sudo command line. If the symbolic link under /dev/shm is replaced with a link to another file before [sudo opens it], it is possible to overwrite an arbitrary file by writing to the standard output or standard error. This can be escalated to full root access by rewriting a trusted file such as /etc/shadow or even /etc/sudoers."
The vulnerability, which affects Sudo 1.8.6p7 through 1.8.20 and marked as high severity, has already been patched in Sudo 1.8.20p1, and users are recommended to update their systems to the latest release.

Red Hat yesterday pushed out patches for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server. Debian has also released fixes for its Wheezy, Jessie and Sid releases and SUSE Linux has rolled out fixes for a number of its products.

Qualys Security said it would publish its Sudoer-to-root exploit once a maximum number of users have had time to patch their systems against the flaw.

Update: Find working Exploits and Proof-of-Concepts at the bottom of this article.

Security researchers have discovered more than a decade-old vulnerability in several Unix-based operating systems ‚Äî including Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD and Solaris ‚Äî which can be exploited by attackers to escalate their privileges to root, potentially leading to a full system takeover.

Dubbed Stack Clash, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000364) has been discovered in the way memory was being allocated on the stack for user space binaries.


Exploiting Stack Clash Bug to Gain Root Access

The explanation is simple: Each program uses a special memory region called the stack, which is used to store short-term data. It expands and contracts automatically during the execution of any program, depending upon the needs of that program.

According to researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Qualys,</span> who discovered and reported this bug, a malicious program can attempt to use more memory space than available on the stack, which could overflow the memory, causing it to collide or clash with nearby memory regions and overwrite their content.

Moreover, the Stack Clash exploit can also bypass the stack guard-page, a memory management protection introduced in 2010, after this issue was exploited in 2005 and 2010.

"Unfortunately, a stack guard-page of a few kilobytes is insufficient: if the stack-pointer 'jumps' over the guard-page‚Äîif it moves from the stack into another memory region without accessing the guard-page‚Äîthen no page-fault exception is raised and the stack extends into the other memory region," an advisory published by Qualys read.
The Stack Clash vulnerability requires local access to the vulnerable system for exploitation, but researchers said it could be exploited remotely depending upon the applications.

For example, a malicious customer with low privilege account with a web hosting company, running vulnerable system, could exploit this vulnerability to gain control over other websites running on the same server, as well as remotely gain root access and execute malicious code directly.

Just yesterday, we reported that how a web hosting company fell victim to a similar attack used to infect Linux servers with a ransomware malware, causing the company to pay more than $1 Million in ransom to get back their files.

Attackers can also combine the Stack Clash bug with other critical vulnerabilities, like the Sudo vulnerability recently patched, and then run arbitrary code with the highest privileges, said Qualys researchers.


7 Proof-of-Concept Exploits

The researchers said they were able to develop seven exploits and seven proofs of concept (PoCs) for the Stack Clash vulnerability, which works on Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD and Solaris on 32-bit and 64-bit x86 processors.

However, the researchers have not yet published the exploits and proofs of concept, giving users and admins enough time to patch their systems before they go into the Stack Clash exploits public.

The PoCs follow four steps, which include 'Clashing' the stack with another memory region, running the stack pointer to the stack‚Äôs start, 'Jumping' over the stack guard-page and 'Smashing' the stack or the other memory regions.

Among distros and systems affected by Stack Clash include:


Sudo on Debian, Ubuntu, and CentOS
ld.so and most SUID-root binaries on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS
Exim on Debian
rsh on Solaris 11 and so on
Red Hat Enterprise


The company also believes that other operating systems, including Microsoft's Windows, Apple's OS X/macOS and Google's Linux-based Android OS could also be vulnerable to Stack Clash, though it is yet to be confirmed.


Patch Available; Update Now

Many affected vendors have already issued security patches for the bug, so users and administrators are advised to install patches a soon as possible.

If security patches from your vendor are yet to be released, you can reboot your systems or can manually apply stack limits to local users' applications. Simply, set the hard RLIMIT STACK and RLIMIT_AS of local users and remote services to a low value.

It is also recommended to recompile all userland code (ld.so, libraries, binaries) with the ‚Äìfstack-check feature. This would prevent the stack pointer from moving into another memory region without accessing the stack guard-page and would kill Stack Clash dead.


Exploits and Proof-of-Concepts Released!

Since Fedora and Slackware have published updates, and FreeBSD and NetBSD have issued patches, Qualys researchers have finally released exploits and POCs for the Stack Clash vulnerability.

You can find all exploits and PoCs here and here.

Brace yourselves for a possible 'second wave' of massive global cyber attack, as SMB (Server Message Block) was not the only network protocol whose zero-day exploits created by NSA were exposed in the Shadow Brokers dump last month.

Although Microsoft released patches for SMB flaws for supported versions in March and unsupported versions immediately after the outbreak of the WannaCry ransomware, the company ignored to patch other three NSA hacking tools, dubbed "EnglishmanDentist," "EsteemAudit," and "ExplodingCan."

It has been almost two weeks since WannaCry ransomware began to spread, which infected nearly 300,000 computers in more than 150 countries within just 72 hours, though now it has been slowed down.

For those unaware, WannaCry exploited a Windows zero-day SMB bug that allowed remote hackers to hijack PCs running on unpatched Windows OS and then spread itself to other unpatched systems using its wormable capability.


EsteemAudit: Over 24,000 PCs Still Vulnerable

EsteemAudit is another dangerous NSA-developed Windows hacking tool leaked by the Shadow Brokers that targets RDP service (port 3389) on Microsoft Windows Server 2003 / Windows XP machines.

Since Microsoft no longer support Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP and unlike EternalBlue the company has not released any emergency patch for EsteemAudit exploit so far, over 24,000 vulnerable systems remains still exposed on the Internet for anyone to hack.

"Even one infected machine opens your enterprise to greater exploitation," say Omri Misgav and Tal Liberman, security researchers at Ensilo cyber security firm who came up with the AtomBombing attack last year and now has released an unofficial patch for EsteemAudit, which we have introduced later in this article.

EsteemAudit can also be used as a wormable malware, similar to the WannaCry ransomware, which allows hackers to propagate in the enterprise networks, leaving thousands of systems vulnerable to ransomware, espionage and other malicious attacks.

Ransomware authors, such as criminals behind CrySiS, Dharma, and SamSam, who are already infecting computers via RDP protocol using brute force attacks, can leverage EsteemAudit anytime for widespread and damaging attacks like WannaCry.


How to Secure Your Computers?


Due to the havoc caused by WannaCry, SMB service gained all the attention, neglecting RDP.

"Windows XP-based systems currently account for more than 7 percent of desktop operating systems still in use today, and the cyber security industry estimates that more than 600,000 web-facing computers, which host upwards of 175 million websites, still run Windows Server 2003 accounting for roughly 18 percent of the global market share," researchers say.
Since Microsoft has not released any patch for this vulnerability, users and enterprises are advised to upgrade their systems to the higher versions to secure themselves from EsteenAudit attacks.

"Of the three remaining exploits, ‚ÄúEnglishmanDentist,‚Äù ‚ÄúEsteemAudit,‚Äù and ‚ÄúExplodingCan,‚Äù none reproduces on supported platforms, which means that customers running Windows 7 and more recent versions of Windows or Exchange 2010 and newer versions of Exchange are not at risk," Microsoft says.
If it's hard for your enterprise to upgrade their systems immediately, it's good for them to secure their RDP port by either disabling it or putting it behind the firewall.

Meanwhile,<span class="highlight-match"> enSilo </span>has released a patch to help Windows XP and Server 2003 users secure their machines against EsteemAudit. You can apply the patch to secure your systems, but keep in mind, that it is not an official patch from Microsoft.

If you have any doubt on the patch, enSilo is a reputed cyber security company, though I expect Microsoft to release an official patch before any outcry like that of WannaCry.

A 17-year-old programming error has been discovered in Microsoft's Windows kernel that could prevent some security software from detecting malware at runtime when loaded into system memory.

The security issue, described by<span class="highlight-match"> enSilo </span>security researcher Omri Misgav, resides in the kernel routine "PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine," which apparently impacts all versions of Windows operating systems since Windows 2000.

Windows has a built-in API, called PsSetLoadImageNotifyRoutine, that helps programs monitor if any new module has been loaded into memory. Once registered, the program receives notification each time a module is loaded into memory. This notification includes the path to the module on disk.

However, Misgav found that due to "caching behaviour, along with the way the file-system driver maintains the file name and a severe coding error," the function doesn't always return the correct path of the loaded modules.

What's bad? It seems like Microsoft has no plans to address this issue, as the software giant does not consider it as a security vulnerability.

"This bug could have security implications for those who aren‚Äôt aware of its existence. We believe that if Microsoft does not plan on fixing this bug, they should at least explicitly warn developers about it in their documentation," says Tal Liberman, head of the research team at enSilo.
The researchers believe this "programmatic error" could theoretically be used by malware authors to bypass antivirus detection‚Äîespecially those security products which rely on this API to check if any malicious code has been loaded into memory‚Äîusing a "series of file operations" to mislead the scanning engine into looking at the wrong file.

So, if your endpoint detection and response products rely on this buggy API, you should either consider not using it or must implement the workaround introduced by the researcher to overcome the loophole.

In a separate blog post, Misgav advised software developers to use another Windows API (FltGetFileNameInformationUnsafe) to check the validity of the module's path using the file object parameter.

If the file exists, it is possible to verify that the file object being loaded into memory is indeed the same file that lies on disk.

For a more technical explanation, you can head on to enSilo's blog.

In separate news, security researchers from Check Point reported about a new attack technique, dubbed Bashware, which takes advantage of Windows built-in Linux subsystem to hide malware from the most security solutions.

Guess what? If you own a Windows PC, which is fully-patched, attackers can still hack your computer.

Isn't that scary? Well, definitely for most of you.

Security researchers have discovered a new technique that could allow attackers to inject malicious code on every version of Microsoft's Windows operating system, even Windows 10, in a manner that no existing anti-malware tools can detect, threaten millions of PCs worldwide.

Dubbed "AtomBombing," the technique does not exploit any vulnerability but abuses a designing weakness in Windows.


New Code Injection Attack helps Malware Bypass Security Measures

AtomBombing attack abuses the system-level Atom Tables, a feature of Windows that allows applications to store information on strings, objects, and other types of data to access on a regular basis.

And since Atom are shared tables, all sorts of applications can access or modify data inside those tables. You can read a more detailed explanation of Atom Tables on Microsoft's blog.

A team of researchers from cyber security company EnSilo, who came up with the AtomBombing technique, say this design flaw in Windows can allow malicious code to modify atom tables and trick legitimate apps into executing malicious actions on its behalf.

Once injected into legitimate processes, the malware makes it easier for attackers to bypass security mechanisms that protect such systems from malware infections, the researchers said.


AtomBombing can Perform MITM Browser attack, Decrypt Passwords, and More

Besides process level restrictions bypass, the AtomBombing code injection technique [source code] also allows attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) browser attacks, remotely take screenshots of targeted user desktops, and access encrypted passwords stored on a browser.

Google Chrome encrypts your saved passwords using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI), which uses data derived from the current user to encrypt or decrypt the data and access the passwords.

So, if malware is injected into a process which is already running in the context of the current user, it is easy to access those passwords in plain text.

Moreover, by injecting code into a web browser, attackers can modify the content shown to the user.


"For example, in a banking transaction process, the customer will always be shown the exact payment information as the customer intended via confirmation screens," said Tal Liberman, Security Research Team Leader of<span class="highlight-match"> enSilo.</span>¬†

"However, the attacker modifies the data so that the bank receives false transaction information in favor of the attacker, i.e. a different destination account number and possibly amount."


No Patch for AtomBombing Attack

What's worse? The company said all versions of Windows operating system, including Microsoft's newest Windows 10, were affected. And What's even worse? There is no fix at this moment.

"Unfortunately, this issue cannot be patched since it does not rely on broken or flawed code ‚Äì rather on how these operating system mechanisms are designed,"¬†said Liberman.

Since the AtomBombing technique exploits legitimate operating system functions to carry out the attack, Microsoft can not patch the issue without changing how the entire operating system works. This is not a feasible solution, so there is no notion of a patch.

For more technical detail about the AtomBombing technique and how it works, you can head on to Breaking Malware¬†for the detailed blog post from Tal Liberman.

Nothing is free in this world.

If you are searching for free ready-made hacking tools on the Internet, then beware‚Äîmost freely available tools, claiming to be the swiss army knife for hackers, are nothing but a hoax.

Last year, we reported about one such Facebook hacking tool that actually had the capability to hack a Facebook account, but yours and not the one you desire to hack.

Now, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) builder kit that was recently spotted on multiple underground hacking forums for free found containing a backdoored module that aims to provide the kit's authors access to all of the victim's data.

Dubbed Cobian RAT, the malware has been in circulation since February of this year and has some similarities with the njRAT and H-Worm family of malware, which has been around since at least 2013.

According to ThreatLabZ researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Zscaler,</span> who discovered the backdoored nature of the malware kit, the "free malware builder" is likely capable of allowing other wannabe hackers to build their own versions of the Cobian RAT with relative ease.

Once the criminals create their own version of malware using this free builder, they can then effectively distribute it via compromised websites or traditional spam campaigns to victims all over the world and is capable of recruiting affected devices into a malicious botnet.

The Cobian RAT then steals data on the compromised system, with the capability to log keystrokes, take screenshots, record audio and webcam video, install and uninstall programs, execute shell commands, use dynamic plug-ins, and manage files.


Cyber Criminals Want to Hack Wannabe Hackers

Now, if you get excited by knowing that all these capabilities offered by the original authors of the malware builder kit are free as they claim, you are mistaken.

Unfortunately, the custom RATs created using this free Cobian RAT malware builder kit has a hidden backdoor module, which silently connects to a Pastebin URL that serves as the kit authors' command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure.

The backdoor, at any time, can be used by the original authors of the kit to issue commands to all RATs built on the top of their platform, eventually putting both wannabe hackers and compromised systems infected by them at risk.

"It is ironic to see that the second level operators, who are using this kit to spread malware and steal from the end user, are getting duped themselves by the original author," Deepen Desai, senior director of security research at Zscaler, wrote in a blog post published Thursday.¬†

"The original author is essentially using a crowdsourced model for building a mega Botnet that leverages the second level operators Botnet."
The researchers also explain that the original Cobian developer is "relying on second-level operators to build the RAT payload and spread infections."

The original author then can take full control of all the compromised systems across all the Cobian RAT botnets, thanks to the backdoor module. They can even remove the second-level operators by changing the C&C server information configured by them.

A recently observed unique Cobian RAT payload by the researchers reportedly came from a Pakistan-based defence and telecommunication solution website (that was potentially compromised) and served inside a .zip archive masquerading as an MS Excel spreadsheet.

The bottom line: Watch out the free online stuff very carefully before using them.

Admit it. Who would not want their firewall maintenance grunt work to go away?

For more than 20 years, companies either managed their edge firewall appliances or had service providers rack-and-stack appliances in their data centers and did it for them.

This was called a managed firewall ‚Äî  an appliance wrapped with a managed service, often from a carrier or managed security service provider (MSSP).

The provider assumed the management of the firewall box, its software, and even its policy and management from the over-burdened IT team. But customers ended up paying for the inefficiency of dealing with appliances (i.e. ‚Äúgrunt work‚Äù) because the problem just shifted to the provider. A new architecture was needed - a transformation from an appliance form factor to a true cloud service. 

In a 2016 Hype Cycle for Infrastructure Protection report, Gartner analyst Jeremy D'Hoinne initiated the emerging category of Firewall as a Service (FWaaS).

He defined FWaaS as ‚Äú...a firewall delivered as a cloud-based service or hybrid solution (that is, cloud plus on-premises appliances). The promise of FWaaS is to provide simpler and more flexible architecture by leveraging centralized policy management, multiple enterprise firewall features and traffic tunneling to partially or fully move security inspections to a cloud infrastructure‚Äù
Recently, in the 2017 Magic Quadrant for Unified Threat Management (SMB Multifunction Firewalls), the analysts reference a Gartner client survey indicating 14% of respondents were likely (8%) or very likely (6%) to consider moving all the firewall security functions to FWaaS. 

FWaaS isn't merely packaging of legacy appliances into a managed service. It is challenging the decades-old concept of the appliance as the primary form factor to deliver network security capabilities. 


What is an FWaaS?
FWaaS offers a single logical firewall that is available anywhere, seamlessly scales to address any traffic workload, enforces unified policy, and self-maintained by a cloud provider.

Let‚Äôs look at these elements in more detail. 

‚Ä¢ Single, global firewall instance¬†‚Äî¬†One firewall instance for the entire global organization is radically different than the current architecture that places a network security stack at each location, a regional hub or a datacenter.

With FWaaS every organizational resource (data center, branch, cloud infrastructure or a mobile user) plugs into the FWaaS global service and leverages all of its security capabilities (application control, URL filtering, IPS, etc). 

‚Ä¢ Seamlessly scales to address inspection workload¬†‚Äî¬†FWaaS provides the necessary compute resources to perform all security processing on all traffic regardless of source or destination.

IT teams no longer need complex sizing processes to determine the appliance capacity needed to plan for today‚Äôs business requirements and future growth.

For example, the increase in SSL traffic volume pressures appliance processing capacity and can force unplanned. FWaaS can scale to accommodate these needs without disrupting the customer‚Äôs business operations.

‚Ä¢ Enforcing a unified policy¬†‚Äî¬†A single firewall, by design, has a single security policy. While legacy appliance vendors created centralized management consoles to ease managing distributed appliances, IT must still consider the individual firewalls instances per location and often customize policies to the locations‚Äô unique attributes.

In heterogenous firewall environments (often created due to M&A) security policy is hard to configure and enforce increasing exposure to hackers and web-borne threats.  Contrast that with a single cloud-based firewall that uniformly applies the security policy on all traffic, for all locations and users.

‚Ä¢ Self-maintained¬†‚Äî¬†One of the most painful aspects of firewall management is maintaining the software through patches and upgrades. It is a risky process that could impact business connectivity and security.

Many IT teams tend to skip or completely avoid software upgrades, leaving enterprise exposed. Because the cloud-based firewall software is maintained by the FWaaS provider and is shared by all customers, the firewall is kept up to date by quickly fixing vulnerabilities and bugs, and rapidly evolving with new features and capabilities that the customers can immediately access. 

FWaaS is bringing genuine relief to overburdened IT teams within enterprises and service providers. Instead of wasting cycles on sizing, deploying, patching, upgrading and configuring numerous edge devices, work can now shift to delivering true security value to the business through early detection and fast mitigation of true risk. 


FWaaS Providers
FWaaS is not a mere concept. It has been deployed in production deployments and by several vendors.

 Cato Networks is a provider of the Cato Cloud, built from the ground up to deliver Firewall as a Service.

Cato provides an optimized, global SD-WAN, ensuring resilient connectivity to its FWaaS in from all regions of the world. Cato can completely eliminate edge firewalls by inspecting both WAN and Internet-bound traffic. The Cato Cloud FWaaS further extends to mobile users and cloud datacenters. 
<span class="highlight-match">
Zscaler </span>provides FWaaS for Internet-bound traffic from remote branches and mobile users. To secure WAN traffic, customers must rely on other means.

Palo Alto Networks recently announced a similar service. It uses its next generation firewall within a cloud service to protect users, whether in remote locations or mobile, accessing the Internet. 

FWaaS is a viable alternative for IT teams that waste time and money to sustain their distributed edge firewall environments ‚Äî the so-called appliance sprawl.

With FWaaS, they can now reduce the operational and capital expense of upgrading and refreshing appliances as well as the attack surface resulting from delayed patches and unmitigated vulnerabilities.

By simplifying the network security architecture, FWaaS makes IT more productive and the business secure.

With rapidly growing web-based services and widely expanding locations, organizations are using more and more SSL certificates as well as SSH keys than ever.

From authentication, confidentiality, and integrity to preventing the organization from industrial espionage, SSL certificates play an important role.

Managing SSL certificates across networks to ensure protection and prevent unanticipated failures is critical, and it also becomes complicated with multiple locations, divisions as well as the fastest growing use of external cloud-based services.

This not only complicates the process of managing individual SSL certificate and SSH key for an administrator but also costs organizations heavily.

A key solution for this issue is to use an advanced and efficient SSL certificate and SSH Key management system.

An effective solution enables an organization to know what kinds of certificates and keys it has, simplifies certificate discovery and monitor across multiple vendors, and also automates certificate renewal and transfer process.

We recently got an opportunity to test and review Key Manager Plus from<span class="highlight-match"> ManageEngine,</span> which is a division of Zoho Corporation that develops remote administration software for IT businesses.

And we were quite impressed by this product that simplifies even complex processes of key management, where most organizations fail, leaving themselves vulnerable to cyber attacks.


ManageEngine Key Manager Plus


ManageEngine Key Manager Plus is a comprehensive, web-based solution that offers centralized management and visibility over the SSL certificates and SSH keys across any organization and helps administrators accurately monitor and manage them.

This application comes with a web-based interface that works on any modern web browser such as Edge, Firefox, and Chrome and you can easily deploy it on your computer with an automated installer.

The dashboard of this application is designed in such a way that after login, you get a broad and easily understandable graphical presentation of all digital assets (SSL certs and SSH keys) used by your organization.

Its user interface and easy to navigate features offer users to keep track of all important details, like the algorithm's encryption type, key length, the creation date of any issue and control new certificate signing requests, as well as access to wider range of tools.


Besides centrally creating and deploying new keys, ManageEngine Key Manager Plus also allows administrators to harden security policies by:

1. Periodically Rotating Key Pairs: Automatically rotating privileged SSH key pairs prevents misuse of keys, reduces security risks, meets compliance requirements and minimizes the operational burden on IT teams.

 2. Delete Unwanted Keys: It is always important to monitor the environment in order to determine which keys are no longer in use and removing them. Key Manager Plus does same. It prevents unauthorized access to privileged accounts by removing unwanted SSH keys from vulnerable endpoints.

3. Terminate or Regulate access: Generally, in a large organization, SSH access is neither controlled nor monitored, which is a cause of most cyber threats to an organization. Administrators can easily monitor and terminate access anytime to prevent violations by obsolete accounts.

 4. Alerts and Notifications: Besides key management, it is always important for an administrator to keep track of SSL certificates, which are about to expire or invalid in order to prevent downtime. This application allows you to set customizable and recurring notifications that alert you when the validity of your SSL cert is about to expire.


Switching to SHA-2 SSL Certificates [Migration Guide]
Nearly a million websites on the Internet are using an insecure algorithm, and leading web browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, have already declared that they could start rejecting website using potentially vulnerable SHA-1 certificates.

Since SHA-1 certs could result in system downtime, errors, and security threats, all organizations need to migrate to SHA-2 signed certificates before January 1, 2017. 

ManageEngine solves this issue as well. Here's a quick step-by-step guide on how to find and replace SHA-1 with secure SHA-2 certificates in your organization using ManageEngine Key Manager Plus.

 Conclusion: ManageEngine Key Manager Plus is an efficient and user-friendly solution that not only helps network administrators bypass complicated and time-consuming compliance processes by providing all the necessary tools for monitoring and managing SSL certificates and SSH keys in the first place, but also predict and prevent security breaches at their organizations.

So, if ManageEngine Key Manager Plus fits for your organization, you can give it a try. The company offers three edition of the latest Key Manager Plus version is 4.5, which includes:

Free Edition: This version of Key Manager Plus is free for lifetime and offers you to manage up to 5 keys in an organization.
Evaluation Edition: This version is a 30-day evaluation edition that allows you to manage up to 10 keys in an organization (Number of keys can be increased based on request during the period of evaluation).
Standard Edition: The prices for this edition start at $595 per year for managing 50 keys.

All editions of ManageEngine Key Manager Plus can be downloaded (Windows/Linux) directly from the ManageEngine official website, and an online demo is also available, in case you want to have a quick look to the application.

Recent corporate breaches have taught us something important ‚Äî the average enterprise user is spectacularly bad at choosing good passwords.

As modern enterprise is becoming a hybrid organization with infrastructure spread across on-premises data centers as well as in the cloud, security of information, applications, and assets has become a paramount concern.

Cyber security is no longer an optional strategy for businesses, where limited visibility into the password practices of employees and ineffective monitoring of privileged credentials could end up an organization with a serious security breach and identity theft.

The first line of defense for any organization or company is passwords, but most organizations grossly underestimate the need to comply with corporate password policies and meet IT regulatory requirements.

Large enterprises have a policy in place that requires end users to choose strong passwords that can withstand dictionary and brute-force attacks, but it comes out to be non-effective, as there are still possibilities that users will go against the policy and pick a simple password.

Even if an organization's IT department forces their employees to choose strong passwords, those strong passwords are stored in text-based files like spreadsheets, or even worse, Word documents.

Not to mention how secure these files are and how able they are to restrict who can access which passwords.

We know that Ignorance is Bliss, but in this case, ignorance can place your enterprise and its data at risk.

In addition to the issues related to creating strong, unique passwords and securely storing them, large enterprises face another important issue - sharing the impersonal administrative accounts among the team members, which can be very challenging. For example, a particular 'administrator' account on Windows will be used by multiple users and all of them will be using the same log in credentials.


The Solution? Password Manager for Enterprise:



Password Manager not only forces one to have strong, unique passwords, but also remembers on your behalf, determines when those passwords have to change, and includes an admin console for controlling all passwords and access to critical services within the enterprise.

I'm impressed with<span class="highlight-match"> ManageEngine'</span>s privileged password management solution ‚Äî Password Manager Pro that already has VMWare, Walmart, EMC2, and NASA on its customer list.

Password Manager Pro (PMP) is specially designed for enterprise teams and provides a complete solution to control, manage, monitor, and audit the entire lifecycle of privileged access, helping them detect suspicious events in real-time.

Password Manager Pro encrypts and stores all your sensitive data in a centralized vault, including passwords, documents, and digital identities, which are then retrieved through a Web interface.

Administrators can consolidate all the passwords, create an¬†inventory, define password policy, set password expiration, and share passwords among authorized users by granting them exclusive privileges or temporary access.

Deploying Password Manager Pro is easy, as it only takes a few minutes for the web-based management software to install its database and web-server, which is available for Windows and Linux.

However, users can access their portal through mobile apps or browser extensions from any device, including Android, iOS, and Windows.

In a single package, Password Manager Pro offers three solutions:


1. Privileged Account Management


Once deployed, Password Manager Pro automatically discovers all IT assets in your network and lists all the privileged accounts associated with them, which enables administrators to quickly secure all the privileged identities by enforcing password management best practices.

This includes the use of strong passwords, securing sensitive data and passwords with AES 256-bit strong encryption, and securely sharing administrative passwords across your organization based on need, with granular access restrictions.

Most importantly, the Password Manager Pro is also designed to automate the password reset and synchronization process across the entire enterprise for a broad range of target systems.

This centralized and enterprise-wide 'Automated Password Resets' feature helps IT administrators get rid of unchanged passwords and protect all sensitive resources from unauthorized access.

In other words, Password Manager Pro allows IT administrator to reset passwords when required or automatically randomizes through scheduled tasks in order to ensure usage of strong passwords and periodic resets by creating and enforcing strict password policies.


2. Remote Access Management

One of the outstanding features of Password Manager Pro is its ability to help administrators launch a direct connection with all remote devices, including those in remote data centers, with just one click from the product's GUI.

With its secure gateways, Password Manager Pro helps you provide remote access to your IT resources to employees and third-party contractors without even disclosing the passwords in plain-text. In other words, PMP enables remote login to devices without sharing passwords at all!

From its web-interface, authorized users can directly launch RDP, SSH, Telnet, and SQL console sessions, wherein all connections will be tunneled through Password Manager Pro's server and require no direct connectivity between the user device and remote host.

This feature has obvious advantages like saving time that usually used to copy/paste passwords from the document, and increasing accountability as PasswordManager Pro tracks access and usage of passwords.


3. Privileged Session Management

The remote connections to devices launched from Password Manager Pro's GUI can be closely monitored through PMP's Privileged Session Manager. All actions done by the users during the privileged session are video recorded and stored for forensic audits. The video records can be played back anytime, to trace actions to users.

Password Manager Pro also includes a session shadowing feature that offers session recording capabilities to real-time monitoring of sensitive privileged sessions launched by other users.

If any suspicious activity is discovered, administrators can immediately terminate sessions in real time, giving admins complete control over privileged sessions.

One can also enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and mobile access for authorized users or groups.


How to Get¬†Password Manager Pro?


Password Manager Pro supports several different user access roles including super admin, admin, and regular password users. An online demo of Password Manager Pro is available here, in case you want to have a quick look to the application.

Besides this, ManageEngine Password Manager Pro is now available in MSP edition as well, which is specially designed for the Managed Service Providers who manages the IT and network infrastructure of their customers.

ManageEngine's Password Manager Pro MSP Edition allows businesses to manage administrative passwords of their clients separately from a single management console or offer Password Management Service to them.

So, if ManageEngine Password Manager Pro fits for your organization, you can give it a try. Pricing depends on the level, number of administrators and language.

The cost varies widely, from the annual subscription of $495 for Standard edition, Single-language, and 2-admin (the number of users is unlimited) to $19,995 for an Enterprise edition, Multi-language, 200-admin, perpetual license.

All editions of ManageEngine Password Manager Pro can be downloaded (Windows/Linux) directly from the ManageEngine official website.

To understand how Password Manager Pro helps mitigate security risks related to privileged access, you can simply download the eBook for free.

It seems sophisticated hackers have changed the way they conduct targeted cyber operations‚Äîinstead of investing in zero-days and developing their malware; some hacking groups have now started using ready-made malware just like script kiddies.

Possibly, this could be a smart move for state-sponsored hackers to avoid being attributed easily.

Security researchers from multiple security firms, including<span class="highlight-match"> Arbor Networks </span>and FireEye, independently discovered a series of malware campaigns primarily targeting aerospace, defence contractors and manufacturing sectors in various countries, including the United States, Thailand, South Korea and India.

What's common? All these attack campaigns, conducted by various hacking groups, eventually install same information and password stealer malware‚Äîdubbed FormBook‚Äîon the targeted systems.

FormBook is nothing but a "malware-as-as-service," which is an affordable piece of data-stealing and form-grabbing malware that has been advertised in various hacking forums since early 2016.

Anyone can rent FormBook for just $29 per week or $59 per month, which offers a range of advanced spying capabilities on target machines, including a keylogger, password stealer, network sniffer, taking the screenshots, web form data stealer and more.

According to the researchers, attackers in each campaign are primarily using emails to distribute the FormBook malware as an attachment in different forms, including PDFs with malicious download links, DOC and XLS files with malicious macros, and archive files (ZIP, RAR, ACE, and ISOs) containing EXE payloads.



Once installed on a target system, the malware injects itself into various processes and starts capturing keystrokes and extracts stored passwords and other sensitive data from multiple applications, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Skype, Safari, Vivaldi, Q-360, Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, 3D-FTP, FileZilla and WinSCP.

FormBook continuously sends all the stolen data to a remote command and control (C2) server which also allows the attacker to execute other commands on the targeted system, including start processes, shutdown and reboot the system, and stealing cookies.

"One of the malware's most interesting features is that it reads Windows‚Äô ntdll.dll module from disk into memory, and calls its exported functions directly, rendering user-mode hooking and API monitoring mechanisms ineffective," FireEye says.

"The malware author calls this technique "Lagos Island method" (allegedly originating from a userland rootkit with this name)."

According to the researchers, FormBook was also seen downloading other malware families such as NanoCore in the last few weeks.

The attackers can even use the data successfully harvested by FormBook for further cybercriminal activities including, identity theft, continued phishing operations, bank fraud and extortion.

FormBook is neither sophisticated, nor difficult-to-detect malware, so the best way to protect yourself from this malware is to keep good antivirus software on your systems, and always keep it up-to-date.

A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for a critical vulnerability in the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) has been publically released that could allow anyone to crash a server with just a single maliciously crafted packet.

The vulnerability has been patched by the Network Time Foundation with the release of NTP 4.2.8p9, which includes a total of 40 security patches, bug fixes, and improvements.

The NTP daemon is used in almost every device that needs to synchronize time on computer clocks. NTP got the most attention in late 2014 and 2015 when hackers used it to launch highly amplified DDoS attacks against services.

The flaw which affects NTP.org's nptd versions prior to 4.2.8p9, but not including ntp-4.3.94, has been discovered by security researcher Magnus Stubman, who privately disclosed it to the Network Time Foundation on June 24.

A patch for the vulnerability was developed and sent to Stubman on 29th September and just two days later, the researcher acknowledged that it mitigated the issue. And now he went with the public disclosure.

"The vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to crash ntpd with a single malformed UDP packet, which causes a null pointer dereference," Stubman wrote in an advisory published Monday.
Stubman also released a PoC exploit that can crash the NTP daemon and creates a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The issue only affects Windows.

Besides Stubman's high severity vulnerability, the latest NTP update also addresses two medium severity bugs, two medium-low severity, and five low-severity security issues; 28 bug fixes, and contains other improvements over 4.2.8p8.

Another major bug is a trap-crash vulnerability reported by Cisco's Matthew Van Gundy.

"If trap service has been explicitly enabled, an attacker can send a specially crafted packet to cause a null pointer dereference that will crash ntpd, resulting in a denial of service," reads the advisory.
CERT at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University has also released the full list of the vulnerabilities in NTP and fixes. It also listed some vendors that implement NTP and could be affected by the bugs.

Since the exploit for the severe bug is available to the public, administrators are strongly recommended to patch their NTP implementations as soon as possible.

In the past, we have seen hackers abusing the NTP servers by sending small spoofed UDP packets to the vulnerable server that requests a significant amount of data (megabytes worth of traffic) to be sent to the DDoS's target IP Address.

Above 400 Gbps NTP amplification¬†DDoS Attack was carried out against content-delivery and anti-DDoS protection firm CloudFlare, and volumetric DDoS attacks exceeding 100 Gbps against popular Gaming services, including League of Legends, EA.com, and Battle.net from Blizzard in 2014.

In a study conducted by<span class="highlight-match"> Arbor Networks </span>in late 2013, the researchers illustrated the effectiveness of NTP amplification attacks that are massive and efficient to take any large server offline because they reflect 1,000 times the size of the initial query back to the target.

Microsoft has been expressing its love for Linux for almost three years now, and this love costs Microsoft an arm and a leg.

Last year, Microsoft surprised everyone by announcing the arrival of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in Windows 10, which brings the Linux command-line shell to Windows, allowing users to run native Linux applications on Windows system without virtualization.

However, security researchers from security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Check Point Software </span>Technologies have discovered a potential security issue with the WSL feature that could allow malware families designed for Linux target Windows computers‚Äîundetected by all current security software.

The researchers devised a new attack technique, dubbed Bashware, that takes advantage of Windows' built-in WSL feature, which is now out of beta and is set to arrive in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update in October 2017.


Bashware Attack Undetectable by All Anti-Virus & Security Solutions

According to CheckPoint researchers, the Bashware attack technique could be abused even by a known Linux malware family, because security solutions for Windows are not designed to detect such threats.

This new attack could allow an attacker to hide any Linux malware from even the most common security solutions, including next generation anti-virus software, malware inspection tools, anti-ransomware solution and other tools.


But why so? Researchers argue that existing security software packages for Windows systems have not yet been modified to monitor processes of Linux executables running on Windows operating system.

"Existing security solutions are still not adapted to monitor processes of Linux executables running on Windows OS, a hybrid concept which allows a combination of Linux and Windows systems to run at the same time," Check Point researchers say.¬†

"This may open a door for cyber criminals wishing to run their malicious code undetected, and allow them to use the features provided by WSL to hide from security products that have not yet integrated the proper detection mechanisms."


Who is the Culprit? Microsoft or Security Vendors?

In order to run the target Linux application in an isolated environment, Microsoft introduced "Pico processes"‚Äîcontainers that allow running of ELF binaries on the Windows operating system.

During their tests, the Check Point researchers were able to test the Bashware attack on "most of the leading antivirus and security products on the market," and successfully bypass all of them.

It is because no security product monitors Pico processes, even when Microsoft already provides Pico API, a special application programming interface that can be used by security companies to monitor such processes.

"Bashware does not leverage any logic or implementation flaws in WSL's design. In fact, WSL seems to be well designed," the researchers concluded.¬†

"What allows Bashware to operate the way it does is the lack of awareness by various security vendors, due to the fact that this technology is relatively new and expands the known borders of the Windows operating system."


Bashware Attackers Requires Admin Rights‚ÄîIs that Hard on Windows PC?

Yes, Bashware requires administrator access on the target computers, but gaining admin privileges on Windows PCs via phishing attacks and/or stolen admin credentials is not a difficult task for a motivated attacker.

However, these additional attacks could also alert antivirus and security products, subverting the attack before the actual Bashware attack can be executed to hide malware.

Since WSL is not turned on by default, and users are required to manually activate "development mode" on their computer systems in order to use it and reboot the system, the risks posed by the feature are mitigated to some extent.

However, the Check Point researchers say it is a little-known fact that the developer mode can be enabled by modifying a few registry keys, which can be done silently in the background by the attackers with the right privileges.

The Bashware attack technique automates the required procedures by silently loading the WSL components, enabling developer mode, even downloading and extracting the Linux file system from Microsoft's servers, and running malware.


No Need to Write Separate Malware Programs

What's interesting about Bashware? Hackers using Bashware are not required to write malware programs for Linux to run them through WSL on Windows computers.

This extra effort is saved by the Bashware technique which installs a program called Wine inside the downloaded Ubuntu user-space environment, and then launches known Windows malware through it.

The malware then initiates into Windows as pico processes, which will hide it from security software.


400 Million Computers Potentially Exposed to Bashware

The newly discovered attack technique does not leverage any implementation of WSL vulnerability, but is due to the lack of interest and awareness by various security vendors towards WSL.

Since the Linux shell is now available to Windows users, researchers believe that Bashware can potentially affect any of the 400 million PCs currently running Windows 10 across the world.

Check Point researchers said their company had already upgraded its security solutions to combat such attacks and are urging other security vendors to modify and update their next-generation anti-virus and security solutions accordingly.

	      Hackers Using Fake Cellphone Towers to Spread Android Banking Trojan [1.07 Points on average]

Chinese Hackers have taken Smishing attack to the next level, using rogue cell phone towers to distribute Android banking malware via spoofed SMS messages.

SMiShing ‚Äî phishing attacks sent via SMS ‚Äî is a type of attack wherein fraudsters use number spoofing attack to send convincing bogus messages to trick mobile users into downloading a malware app onto their smartphones or lures victims into giving up sensitive information.

Security researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> Check Point Software </span>Technologies have uncovered that Chinese hackers are using fake base transceiver stations (BTS towers) to distribute "Swearing Trojan," an Android banking malware that once appeared neutralized after its authors were arrested in a police raid.

This is the first ever reported real-world case in which criminals played smart in such a way that they used BTS ‚Äî a piece of equipment usually installed on cellular telephone towers ‚Äî to spread malware.

The phishing SMS, which masquerades itself as the one coming from Chinese telecom service providers China Mobile and China Unicom, contains very convincing text with a link to download malicious Android APK.

Since Google Play Store is blocked in China, the SMS easily tricks users into installing the APK from an untrusted source.

"Using a BTS to send fake messages is quite sophisticated, and the SMS content is very deceptive. The message tricks users into clicking a malicious URL which installs malware," the researchers said in the blog post.
Once installed, the Swearing malware distributes itself by sending automated phishing SMSes to a victim's contacts.

However the maximum range of a BTS antenna may be as low as 10-22 miles, the technique is very successful and sophisticated in targeted attacks.

Discovered last year by Tencent Security researchers, the Swearing Trojan has the capability to steal bank credentials and other sensitive information from victim Android devices and to bypass two-factor authentication by replacing a user's legit SMS app with a malicious version that intercepts incoming SMS messages.

What's more interesting? To avoid detection of any malicious activity, the Swearing trojan doesn't connect to any remote command-and-control (C&C) server. Instead, it uses SMS or emails to send stolen data back to the hackers.

"This provides the malware with good cover for its communications and hinders attempts to trace any malicious activity."
While this particular malware campaign has usually targeted Chinese users, Check Point researchers warned in a blog post that the threat could quickly spread worldwide when adopted by Western malware.

The malware scheme seems to be larger than previously thought, as according to researchers, only 21cn.com email addresses were used in the initial malware campaign, while new attacks used other popular Chinese email service providers, such as 163.com, sina.cn, and qq.com, and Alibaba Cloud and other cloud service hosted email accounts as well.

Check Point also points out the nasty HummingBad malware trojan that was also discovered in the Chinese mobile market, and "turned out to be early birds which continued to spread worldwide" if adopted by western malware.

Besides a previously undisclosed code-execution flaw in Microsoft Word, the tech giant patches two more zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers had been exploiting in the wild for months, as part of this month's Patch Tuesday.

In total, Microsoft patches 45 unique vulnerabilities in its nine products, including three previously undisclosed vulnerabilities under active attack.

The first vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) under attack is a remote-code execution flaw that could allow an attacker to remotely take over a fully patched and up to date computer when the victim opens a Word document containing a booby-trapped OLE2link object.

The attack can bypass most exploit mitigations developed by Microsoft, and according to Ryan Hanson of security firm Optiv, in some cases, exploits can execute malicious code even when Protected View is enabled.

As The Hacker News reported Monday, this code-execution flaw in Microsoft Word was being exploited by hackers to spread a version of infamous Dridex banking trojan. 

Also, according to blog posts published Tuesday by security firms FireEye and<span class="highlight-match"> Netskope,</span> hackers are exploiting the same Word vulnerability to install Latentbot and Godzilla malware respectively.

Microsoft has released a fix for CVE-2017-0199 and credited Hanson with responsible reporting the critical vulnerability to the company.


Patch for Critical IE Flaw Being Exploited in the Wild

The company also pushed out a patch for another critical vulnerability (CVE-2017-0210) under active attack. The flaw is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Internet Explorer that would allow an attacker to trick a victim into visiting a compromised website.

The vulnerability could allow the attacker to access sensitive information from one domain and inject it into another domain.

"The vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, the vulnerability could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (for example, a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code," Microsoft's guidance for the flaw reads.
This IE vulnerability is also being exploited in the wild.


Another Critical Word Vulnerability Yet Unpatched!

The third previously undisclosed flaw (CVE-2017-2605) resides in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) filter in Microsoft Office, but Microsoft did not actually release an update for this flaw in Tuesday's update batch.

However, the tech giant issued an update for Microsoft Office that, by default, disable the EPS filter in MS Office as a defense measure. This Word vulnerability is also being exploited in the wild when a target opens a malicious EPS image in Word.

"Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks that could leverage an unpatched vulnerability in the EPS filter and is taking this action to help reduce customer risk until the security update is released," the guidance for the flaw reads.
The company also issued a patch for Windows 10 Creators Update, which was made available on Tuesday, addressing some remote code execution flaws and elevation of privilege bugs.

In total, Microsoft rolled out 15 security updates on Tuesday patching dozens of unique CVEs in its products, including the Windows OS, Exchange Server, Edge and Internet Explorer, Office, Office Services and Office Web Apps, Visual Studio for Mac Silverlight and Adobe Flash.

Users are strongly advised to install updates as soon as possible in order to protect themselves against the active attacks in the wild on three separate Microsoft products.

Cybercrime has continued to evolve and today exists in a highly organised form.

Cybercrime has increasingly been commercialised, and itself become big business by renting out an expanded range of hacking tools and technologies, from exploit kits to ransomware, to help anyone build threats and launch attacks.

In past few years, we have witnessed the increase in the popularity of malware-as-a-service (MaaS), which is today a prosperous business on the underground black market that offers an array of services, including ransomware-as-a-service, DDoS-as-a-service, phishing-as-a-service, and much more.

Two such services have recently been spotted by two separate group of researchers, which we have detailed in this article.


Ovidiy Stealer ‚Äî¬†$7 Password-Stealing Malware For Everyone


A new credential stealing malware that targets primarily web browsers is being marketed at Russian-speaking web forums for as cheap as $7, allowing anyone with even little technical knowledge to hack as many computers as they want.

Dubbed Ovidiy Stealer, the malware was initially appeared just last month but is being regularly updated by its Russian-speaking authors and actively adopted by cyber criminals.

The Ovidiy Stealer malware currently has several versions in the wild, targeting people around the world, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, India, and Russia, according to security researchers at Proofpoint, who analysed the malware.

What's surprising is the Ovidiy Stealer's cost.

A single customizable build of this lightweight, easy-to-use, and effective malware product only costs between 450 and 750 Rubles (nearly $7 and $13), according to security researchers at Proofpoint, who uncovered and analysed the malware.

Despite its low price, the malware build executables are encrypted, which make them difficult to detect and analyse, though the report also notes that some antivirus products are detecting Ovidiy Stealer with its behaviour.

Written in .NET, the credentials stealer malware comes with the ability to target multiple applications and browsers, including Google Chrome, Opera, FileZilla, Amigo, Kometa, Torch, and Orbitum, but buyers can purchase a version that only works on a single browser.

The malware is being distributed via a number of methods, including malicious email attachments, malicious links to a download, fake software or tools offered on various file-hosting websites, and even within software packages.

Ovidiy Stealer itself is not very powerful and advanced, as it does not include any persistence mechanism that allows the malware to run after a reboot, but it has the potential to become widespread.

Ovidiy Stealer uses SSL/TLS connection for secure communication with the command and control server, which is hosted on a Russian domain ‚Äî the same domain used to market and sell the malware.

"A lightweight, easy-to-use, and effective product coupled with frequent updates and a stable support system give Ovidiy Stealer the potential to become a much more widespread threat," the report concluded.¬†

"Ovidiy Stealer highlights the manner in the cybercrime marketplace drives innovation and new entrants and challenges organisations that must keep pace with the latest threats to their users, their data, and their systems."


Hackshit ‚Äî Easier Phishing Than Ever Before!


Another crimeware-as-a-service uncovered by researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> Netskope </span>Threat Research Labs detailed a Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS) platform that offers low cost, "automated solution for the beginner scammers," allowing them to trick people into handing over their credentials.

Dubbed Hackshit, the PhaaS platform attracts new subscribers by offering them free trial accounts to review their limited set of hacking tutorials and tricks to make easy money.

"The marketplace is a portal that offers services to purchase and sell for carrying out the phishing attacks," Netskope researcher Ashwin Vamshi says.¬†

"The attacker then generates a phished page from the page/generator link and logs into the email account of the compromised victim, views all the contacts and sends an email embedded with the phished link."
Hackshit allows wannabe hackers (subscribers) to generate their unique phishing pages for several services, including Yahoo, Facebook, and Google's Gmail.

Researchers noted that the phishing pages use data URI scheme to serve base64 encoded content from "a secure HTTPS websites with ".moe" top level domain (TLD) to evade traditional scanners."

"Based on one of the video tutorials we observed, the attacker purchases site login accounts of compromised victim from the marketplace using Perfect Money or bitcoins," the researcher says.
Moreover, Hackshit website is using an SSL certificate issued by Let's Encrypt ‚Äî the open certificate authority (CA) that offers free SSL/TLS (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security) certificates for web servers, making HTTPS implementation easier for everyone.

These crimeware-as-a-service poses a new security challenge because it not only allows malicious actors to leverage other cybercriminals' resources to conduct attacks, but also bringing wannabe hackers into the world of cybercrime.

A team of security researchers from Cybellum, an Israeli zero-day prevention firm, has discovered a new Windows vulnerability that could allow hackers to take full control of your computer.

Dubbed DoubleAgent, the new injecting code technique works on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems, starting from Windows XP to the latest release of Windows 10.

What's worse? DoubleAgent exploits a 15-years-old undocumented legitimate feature of Windows called "Application Verifier," which cannot be patched.

Application Verifier is a runtime verification tool that loads DLLs (dynamic link library) into processes for testing purpose, allowing developers quickly detect and fix programming errors in their applications.


Unpatchable Microsoft Application Verifier Exploit

The vulnerability resides in how this Application Verifier tool handles DLLs. According to the researchers, as part of the process, DLLs are bound to the target processes in a Windows Registry entry, but attackers can replace the real DLL with a malicious one.

Simply by creating a Windows Registry key with the name same as application he wants to hijack, an attacker can provide his own custom verifier DLL he would like to inject into a legitimate process of any application.

Once the custom DLL has been injected, the attacker can take full control of the system and perform malicious actions, such as installing backdoors and persistent malware, hijacking the permissions of any existing trusted process, or even hijacking other users‚Äô sessions.

Here's how the Cybellum researchers say this attack can work:

"DoubleAgent gives the attacker the ability to inject any DLL into any process. The code injection occurs extremely early during the victim‚Äôs process boot, giving the attacker full control over the process and no way for the process to protect itself."


Using DoubleAgent Attack to Take Full Control of Anti-Virus


In order to demonstrate the DoubleAgent attack, the team hijacked anti-virus applications -- which is the main defense on systems to prevent any malware from running -- using their technique and turn them into malware.

The team was able to corrupt the anti-virus app using the DoubleAgent attack and get the security software to act as disk-encrypting ransomware.

The attack works on every version of Windows OS from Windows XP to Windows 10 and is hard to block because the malicious code can be re-injected into the targeted legitimate process after the system reboots ‚Äì Thanks to the persistent registry key.

The researchers said most of the today's security products on the market are susceptible to the DoubleAgent attacks. Here's the list of affected security products:


Avast (CVE-2017-5567)
AVG (CVE-2017-5566)<span class="highlight-match">
Avira </span>(CVE-2017-6417)
Bitdefender (CVE-2017-6186)
Trend Micro (CVE-2017-5565)
Comodo
ESET
F-Secure
Kaspersky
Malwarebytes
McAfee
Panda
Quick Heal
Norton


After hijacking the anti-virus software, attackers can also use the DoubleAgent attack to disable the security product, making it blind to malware and cyber attacks, using the security product as a proxy to launch attacks on the local computer or network, elevating the user privilege level of all malicious code, hiding malicious traffic or exfiltrate data, or damaging the OS or causing a denial of service.

Note: Cybellum researchers only focused on anti-virus programs, though the DoubleAgent attack could work with any application, even Windows operating system itself.


Many Antiviruses Still Unpatched Even After 90 Days Of Responsible Disclosure

Cybellum said the company had reported the DoubleAgent attack to all affected anti-virus vendors more than 90 days ago.

Cybellum researchers have been working with some anti-virus companies to patch the issue, but so far, only Malwarebytes and AVG have released a patch, while Trend-Micro has planned to release one soon, as well.

So, if you use any of the three apps mentioned above, you are strongly advised to update it as soon as possible.

As a mitigation, the researchers note that the simplest fix for antivirus vendors is to switch from Application Verifier to a newer architecture called Protected Processes.

Protected processes mechanism protects anti-malware services against such attacks by not allowing other apps from injecting unsigned code, but this mechanism has so far been implemented only in Windows Defender, which was introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8.1.

Cybellum has also provided a video demonstration of the DoubleAgent attack, showing how they turned an antivirus app into a ransomware that encrypts files until you pay up.

The company also posted proof-of-concept (PoC) code on GitHub, and two blog posts detailing the DoubleAgent attack.

The Shadow Brokers who previously stole and leaked a portion of the NSA hacking tools and exploits is back with a Bang!

The hacking group is now selling another package of hacking tools, ‚ÄúEquation Group Windows Warez,‚Äù which includes Windows exploits and antivirus bypass tools, stolen from the NSA-linked hacking unit, The Equation Group.

For those unfamiliar with the topic, The Shadow Brokers is a notorious group of black-hat hackers who, in August 2016, leaked exploits, security vulnerabilities, and "powerful espionage tools" created by The Equation Group.

On Saturday, the Shadow Brokers posted a message on their ZeroNet based website, announcing the sale of the entire "Windows Warez" collection for 750 Bitcoin (around US$678,630).

The data dump contains many windows hacking tools, categorized as following:

Fuzzing tools (used to discover errors and security loopholes)
Exploit Framework
Network Implants
Remote Administration Tools (RAT)
Remote Code Execution Exploits for IIS, RDP, RPC, SMB Protocols (Some Zero-Days)
SMB BackDoor (Implant)

Interestingly, the Remote Administration Tool (RAT) "DanderSpritz" included in the list is the one previously leaked in the NSA's documents revealed by Edward Snowden.

Besides this, malware researcher Jacob Williams analyzed the archive of "screenshots and output of the find command across the dump" provided by the hacker as an evidence of legitimacy and estimated that the tools may also include a Fully Undetectable Malware (FUD) toolkit.


The FUD toolkit might have an ability to "evade/bypass personal security products," such as<span class="highlight-match"> Avira,</span> Avast, Dr.Web, ESET Antivirus, Comodo, McAfee Antivirus, Microsoft Essential, Panda, Symantec, Trend Micro and Kaspersky Antivirus.

The buyers can purchase the entire database of hacking tools that The Equation Group used against various countries to expand its espionage operations.

In August, the Shadow Brokers announced an auction attempting to sell the complete set of tools to the highest bidder, but the group canceled their auction in October due to little or no response on their public sale.

But since this time the group has made Windows hacking tools up for sale, the chances are that hackers and espionage groups would be interested in buying these hacking tools.

Security researchers have discovered a critical remotely exploitable vulnerability in an open-source software development library used by major manufacturers of the Internet-of-Thing devices that eventually left millions of devices vulnerable to hacking.

The vulnerability (CVE-2017-9765), discovered by researchers at the IoT-focused security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Senrio,</span> resides in the software development library called gSOAP toolkit (Simple Object Access Protocol) ‚Äî an advanced C/C++ auto-coding tool for developing XML Web services and XML application.

Dubbed "Devil's Ivy," the stack buffer overflow vulnerability allows a remote attacker to crash the SOAP WebServices daemon and could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable devices.


The Devil's Ivy vulnerability was discovered by researchers while analysing an Internet-connected security camera manufactured by Axis Communications.

"When exploited, it allows an attacker to remotely access a video feed or deny the owner access to the feed," researchers say.¬†

"Since these cameras are meant to secure something, like a bank lobby, this could lead to collection of sensitive information or prevent a crime from being observed or recorded."

Axis confirmed the vulnerability that exists in almost all of its 250 camera models (you can find the complete list of affected camera models here) and has quickly released patched firmware updates on July 6th to address the vulnerability, prompting partners and customers to upgrade as soon as possible.

However, researchers believe that their exploit would work on internet-connected devices from other vendors as well, as the affected software is used by Canon, Siemens, Cisco, Hitachi, and many others.

Axis immediately informed Genivia, the company that maintains gSOAP, about the vulnerability and Genivia released a patch on June 21, 2017.

The company also reached out to electronics industry consortium ONVIF to ensure all of its members, including Canon, Cisco, and Siemens, those who make use of¬†gSOAP¬†become aware of the issue and can develop patches to fix the security hole.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices has always been the weakest link and, therefore, an easy entry for hackers to get into secured networks. So it is always advisable to keep your Internet-connected devices updated and away from the public Internet.

Here we are with our weekly roundup, briefing this week's top cyber security threats, incidents and challenges.

This week has been very short with big news from shutting down of two of the largest Dark Web marketplaces and theft of millions of dollars in the popular Ethereum cryptocurrency to the discovery of new Linux malware leveraging SambaCry exploit.

We are here with the outline of this week's stories, just in case you missed any of them. We recommend you read the entire thing (just click 'Read More' because there's some valuable advice in there as well).

Here's the list of this Week's Top Stories:


1. Feds Shuts Down AlphaBay and Hansa Dark Web Markets ‚Äî Dream Market Under Suspicion

On Thursday, Europol announced that the authorities had shut down two of the largest criminal Dark Web markets ‚Äî AlphaBay and Hansa ‚Äî in what's being called the largest-ever international operation against the dark web's black market conducted by the FBI, DEA and Dutch National Police.

Interestingly, the federal authorities shut down AlphaBay, but before taking down Hansa market, they took control of the Dark Web market and kept it running for at least a month in an effort to monitor the activities of its visitors, including a massive flood of Alphabay refugees.

After the shutdown of both AlphaBay and Hansa, Dream Market has emerged as the leading player, which has been in business since 2013, but it has now been speculated by many dark web users that Dream Market is also under police control.

For detailed information ‚Äî Read more.


2. New Ransomware Threatens to Send Your Internet History to All Your Friends

After WannaCry and Petya ransomware outbreaks, a new strain of ransomware has been making the rounds on the Google Play Store in bogus apps, which targets Android mobile phone users.

Dubbed LeakerLocker, instead of encrypting files on your device, this Android ransomware secretly collects personal images, messages and browsing history and then threatens to share them with your contacts if you don't pay $50 (¬£38).

For more detailed information on the LeakerLocker ransomware ‚Äî Read more.


3. New CIA Leaks ‚Äî Smartphone Hacking and Malware Development


WikiLeaks last week published the 16th batch of its ongoing Vault 7 leak, revealing the CIA's Highrise Project that allowed the spying agency to stealthy collect and forwards stolen data from compromised smartphones to its server through SMS messages.

This week, the whistleblowing organisation revealed about a CIA contractor ‚Äî Raytheon Blackbird Technologies ‚Äî who was responsible for analysing advanced malware and hacking techniques being used in the wild by cyber criminals.

For more detailed information on Highrise Project and its contractor Raytheon Blackbird Technologies ‚Äî Read More.


4. Three Back-to-Back Multi-Million Dollar Ethereum Heist in 20 Days

This week, an unknown hacker stole nearly $32 Million worth of Ethereum ‚Äì one of the most popular and increasingly valuable cryptocurrencies ‚Äì from wallet accounts linked to at least three companies by exploiting a critical vulnerability in Parity's Ethereum Wallet software.

This was the third Ethereum cryptocurrency heist that came out two days after an alleged hacker stole $7.4 Million worth of Ether from trading platform CoinDash and two weeks after someone hacked into South Korean cryptocurrency exchange and stole more than $1 Million in Ether and Bitcoins from user accounts.

For more detailed information about the Ethereum Heist ‚Äî Read More.


5. Critical Gnome Flaw Leaves Linux PCs Vulnerable

This week has been bad for Linux users as well. A security researcher discovered a code injection vulnerability in the thumbnail handler component of GNOME Files file manager that allowed hackers to execute malicious code on targeted Linux machines.

German researcher Nils Dagsson Moskopp dubbed the vulnerability Bad Taste (CVE-2017-11421) and also released proof-of-concept (PoC) code on his blog to demonstrate the vulnerability.

For more details about the Bad Taste vulnerability and its PoC ‚Äî Read More.


6. New Malware Exploits SambaCry to Hijack NAS Devices


Despite being patched in late May, the SambaCry vulnerability is currently being leveraged by a new piece of malware to target the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, particularly Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances.

SambaCry is a 7-year-old critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (CVE-2017-7494) in Samba networking software that could allow a hacker to remotely take full control of a vulnerable Linux and Unix machines.

The flaw was discovered and patched two months ago, but researchers at Trend Micro warned that the flaw had been actively exploited by the SHELLBIND malware that mostly targets NAS devices used by small and medium-size businesses.

For more detailed information on the SHELLBIND malware ‚Äî Read More.


7. Devil's Ivy ‚Äî Millions of Internet-Connected Devices At Risk

This week, researchers at the IoT-focused security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Senrio </span>discovered a critical remotely exploitable vulnerability in an open-source software development library used by major  IoT manufacturers that eventually left millions of smart devices vulnerable to hacking.

Dubbed Devil's Ivy, the vulnerability (CVE-2017-9765) in the gSOAP toolkit (Simple Object Access Protocol) ‚Äî an advanced C/C++ auto-coding tool for developing XML Web services and XML application.

The researchers also released proof-of-concept (PoC) video demonstrating the RCE on a security camera manufactured by Axis Communications.

For more detailed information on the Devil's Ivy and PoC video ‚Äî Read More.


8. ‚ÄúUbuntu Linux for Windows 10 Released‚Äù ‚Äî Sounds So Weird?

Downloading an entire operating system has just become as easy as downloading an application for Windows 10 users, as Microsoft last week announced the availability of popular Linux distro 'Ubuntu' in the Windows App Store.

While the company announced its plans to launch Fedora and SUSE Linux as well on Windows Store, the company did not reveal exactly when its users can expect to see these two flavours of Linux distro on the App Store.

For detailed information on how to install and run Ubuntu on Windows 10 ‚Äî Read More.


9. Over 70,000 Memcached Servers Vulnerable to Hacking


It's been almost eight months since the Memcached developers have patched several critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in the software, but tens of thousands of servers running Memcached application are still vulnerable.

Cisco's Talos intelligence and research group last year discovered three critical RCE vulnerabilities in Memcached ‚Äî a moderhttp://thehackernews.com/2017/07/segway-hoverboard-hacking.htmln open-source and easily deployable distributed caching system that allows objects to be stored in memory.

The vulnerability exposed major websites including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, to hackers, but the team of researchers scanned the internet on two different occasions and found that over 70,000 servers are still vulnerable to the attacks, including ransomware attacks similar to the one that hit MongoDB databases in late December.

For more in-depth information on the Memcached vulnerabilities ‚Äî Read More.


10. Tor Launches Bug Bounty Program for Public

After its intention to launch a public bug bounty program in late December 2015, the Tor Project has finally launched a "Bug Bounty Program," encouraging hackers and security researchers to find and privately report bugs that could compromise the anonymity network.

The bug bounty reports will be sent through HackerOne ‚Äî a startup that operates bug bounty programs for companies including Yahoo, Twitter, Slack, Dropbox, Uber, General Motors ‚Äì and even the U.S. Department of Defense for Hack the Pentagon initiative.

For detailed information on bug bounty prices and types of valid vulnerabilities ‚Äî Read More.

Watch out, readers! It is ransomware, another WannaCry, another wide-spread attack.

The WannaCry ransomware is not dead yet and another large scale ransomware attack is making chaos worldwide, shutting down computers at corporates, power supplies, and banks across Russia, Ukraine, Spain, France, UK, India, and Europe and demanding $300 in bitcoins.

According to multiple sources, a new variant of Petya ransomware, also known as Petwrap, is spreading rapidly with the help of same Windows SMBv1 vulnerability that the WannaCry ransomware abused to infect 300,000 systems and servers worldwide in just 72 hours last month.

Apart from this, many victims have also informed that Petya ransomware has also infected their patch systems.


"Petya uses the NSA Eternalblue exploit but also spreads in internal networks with WMIC and PSEXEC. That's why patched systems can get hit." Mikko Hypponen¬†confirms, Chief Research Officer at F-Secure.

Petya is a nasty piece of ransomware and works very differently from any other ransomware malware. Unlike other traditional ransomware, Petya does not encrypt files on a targeted system one by one.

Instead, Petya reboots victims computers and encrypts the hard drive's master file table (MFT) and renders the master boot record (MBR) inoperable, restricting access to the full system by seizing information about file names, sizes, and location on the physical disk.

Petya ransomware replaces the computer's MBR with its own malicious code that displays the ransom note and leaves computers unable to boot.


Don't Pay Ransom, You Wouldn‚Äôt Get Your Files Back¬†
Infected users are advised not to pay the ransom because hackers behind Petya ransomware can‚Äôt get your emails anymore.

Posteo, the German email provider, has suspended the email address i.e. wowsmith123456@posteo.net, which was behind used by the criminals to communicate with victims after getting the ransom to send the decryption keys.

At the time of writing, 23 victims have¬†paid¬†in Bitcoin to '1Mz7153HMuxXTuR2R1t78mGSdzaAtNbBWX' address¬†for decrypting their files infected by Petya, which total roughly $6775.

Petya! Petya! Another Worldwide Ransomware Attack



Screenshots of the latest Petya infection, shared on Twitter, shows that the ransomware displays a text, demanding $300 worth of Bitcoins. Here's what the text read:

"If you see this text, then your files are no longer accessible, because they are encrypted. Perhaps you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don't waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service."
According to a recent VirusTotal scan, currently, only 16 out of 61 anti-virus services are successfully detecting the Petya ransomware malware.


Petya Ransomware Hits Banks, Telecom, Businesses & Power Companies


Supermarket in Kharkiv, East Ukraine

Petya ransomware has already infected ‚Äî¬†Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft, Ukrainian state electricity suppliers, "Kyivenergo" and "Ukrenergo," in past few hours.

"We were attacked. Two hours ago, we had to turn off all our computers. We are waiting for permission from Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) to switch them back on," Kyivenergo's press service said.
There are reports from several banks, including National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and Oschadbank, as well as other companies confirming they have been hit by the Petya ransomware attacks.

Maersk, an international logistics company, has also confirmed on Twitter that the latest Petya ransomware attacks have shut down its IT systems at multiple locations and business units.

"We can confirm that Maersk IT systems are down across multiple sites and business units. We are currently asserting the situation. The safety of our employees, our operations and customers' business is our top priority. We will update when we have more information," the company said.
The ransomware also impacts multiple workstations at Ukrainian branch's mining company Evraz.

The most severe damages reported by Ukrainian businesses also include¬†compromised systems at Ukraine's local metro and Kiev's Boryspil Airport.

Three Ukrainian telecommunication operators, Kyivstar, LifeCell, Ukrtelecom, are also affected in the latest Petya attack.


How Petya Ransomware Spreading So Fast?

Symantec, the cyber security company, has also confirmed that Petya ransomware is exploiting SMBv1 EternalBlue exploit,¬†just like¬†WannaCry, and taking advantage of unpatched Windows machines.

"Petya ransomware successful in spreading because it combines both a client-side attack (CVE-2017-0199) and a network based threat (MS17-010),"¬†security¬†researcher using Twitter handle ‚ÄèHackerFantastic¬†tweeted.

EternalBlue is a Windows SMB exploit leaked by the infamous hacking group Shadow Brokers in its April data dump, who claimed to have stolen it from the US intelligence agency NSA, along with other Windows exploits.

Microsoft has since patched the vulnerability for all versions of Windows operating systems, but many users remain vulnerable, and a string of malware variants are exploiting the flaw to deliver ransomware and mine cryptocurrency.

Just three days ago, we reported about the latest WannaCry attack that hit Honda Motor Company and around 55 speed¬†and traffic light cameras in Japan and Australia, respectively.

Well, it is quite surprising that even after knowing about the WannaCry issue for quite a decent amount of time, big corporates and companies have not yet implemented proper security measures to defend against such threat.


How to Protect Yourself from Ransomware Attacks


What to do immediately? Go and apply those¬†goddamn patches¬†against EternalBlue (MS17-010) and disable the unsecured, 30-year-old¬†SMBv1 file-sharing protocol¬†on your Windows systems and¬†servers.

Since¬†Petya Ransomware is also taking advantage of WMIC and PSEXEC tools to infect fully-patched Windows computers, you are also advised to disable WMIC (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line).


Prevent Infection & Petya Kill-Switch
Researcher¬†finds¬†Petya ransomware encrypt systems after rebooting the computer. So if your system is infected with Petya ransomware and it tries to restart, just do not power it back on.

"If machine reboots and you see this message, power off immediately! This is the encryption process. If you do not power on, files are fine." ‚ÄèHackerFantastic¬†tweeted. "Use a LiveCD or external machine to recover files"
PT Security, a UK-based cyber security company and¬†Amit Serper¬†from<span class="highlight-match"> Cybereason,</span> have discovered a Kill-Switch for Petya ransomware. According to a tweet, company has advised users to create a file i.e. "C:\Windows\perfc" to prevent ransomware infection.

To safeguard against any ransomware infection, you should always be suspicious of unwanted files and documents sent over an email and should never click on links inside them unless verifying the source.

To always have a tight grip on your valuable data, keep a good back-up routine in place that makes their copies to an external storage device that isn't always connected to your PC.

Moreover, make sure that you run a good and effective anti-virus security suite on your system, and keep it up-to-date. Most importantly, always browse the Internet safely.

Ransomware has risen dramatically since last few years, so rapidly that it might have already hit you or someone you know.

With hundred of thousands of ransomware variants emerging every day, it is quite difficult for traditional signature-based antivirus tools to keep their signature database up-to-date.

So, if signature-based techniques are not enough to detect ransomware infection, then what else can we do?

The solution is RansomFree.

Boston-based cyber security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Cybereason </span>has released RansomFree ‚Äî a real-time ransomware detection and response software that can spot most strains of Ransomware before it starts encrypting files and alert the user to take action.

RansomFree is a free standalone product and is compatible with PCs running Windows 7, 8 and 10, as well as Windows Server 2010 R2 and 2008 R2.

Instead of regularly updated malware signatures to fight the bad programs, RansomFree uses "behavioral and proprietary deception" techniques to detect new ransomware variants in action before the threat has a chance to encrypt your data.


The company analyzed tens of thousands of ransomware variants belonging to more than 40 ransomware strains, including Locky, TeslaCrypt, Cryptowall, and Cerber and "identified the behavioral patterns that distinguish ransomware from legitimate applications."

"The ability to detect and stop never-before-seen ransomware is one of the features that makes RansomFree so unique," the company's spokesperson told The Hacker News. "The tool identifies ransomware behaviors including attempts targeting local disks, as well as detecting and stopping encryption over shared network drives."
If it finds any such behavior on your PC, RansomFree suspends that program and flags it for your review. It‚Äôs then up to you to either enable the program or allow RansomFree to stop it permanently.

By default, the anti-ransomware tool suspends any activity it finds suspicious ‚Äî even if it is a legitimate encryption software that has some behavior in common with ransomware.

With this type of approach, even brand new ransomware infections will be stopped in their tracks without you having to worry about updates to the malicious software.

"Pervasive ransomware variants have outsmarted traditional endpoint defenses, such as antivirus software, leaving individuals exposed to the real dangers of cyber crime," said Uri Sternfield, Cybereason Senior Security Researcher.¬†

"What's worse, a major part of the consumer population threatened by ransomware attacks have little recourse but to either pay the ransom, or risk losing their stolen content."
RansomFree can detect 99 percent of all ransomware strains and will also offer you protection against future ransomware strains, as the company said RansomFree would be updated daily in an attempt to stay ahead in this arms race.

RansomFree is free to download directly from Cybereason's official site.

Earlier this year, we also reported about another behavior-based anti-ransomware tool, dubbed RansomWhere, available for Mac OS X users that can identify ransomware-like behavior by continually monitoring the file-system for the creation of encrypted files by suspicious processes.

RansomWhere also works in a similar way like RansomFree, blocking the suspicious processes and waiting for the user to decide whether to allow or stop the process.

Besides using an anti-ransomware tool, you are also recommended to regularly backup your files, keep your OS and software programs up-to-date, disable Java and Flash when possible, do not download apps from unknown, untrusted websites, and be extra conscious when opening links and downloading attachments in an email.

It might be the easiest bug bounty program ever.

Netgear launched on Thursday a bug bounty program to offer up to $15,000 in rewards to hackers who will find security flaws in its products.

Since criminals have taken aim at a rapidly growing threat surface created by millions of new Internet of things (IoT) devices, it has become crucial to protect routers that contain the keys to the kingdom that connects the outside world to the IP networks that run these connected devices.

To combat this issue, Netgear, one of the biggest networking equipment providers in the world, has launched a bug bounty program focusing on its products, particularly routers, wireless security cameras and mesh Wi-Fi systems.

Bug bounty programs are cash rewards given by companies or organizations to white hat hackers and researchers who hunt for serious security vulnerabilities in their website or products and then responsibly disclose for the patch release.

Bug bounties are designed to encourage security researchers, hackers and enthusiasts to responsibly report the vulnerabilities they discovered, rather than selling or exploiting it.

On Thursday, Netgear announced that the company has partnered up with<span class="highlight-match"> Bugcrowd </span>to launch Netgear Responsible Disclosure Program that can earn researchers cash rewards ranging from $150 to $15,000 for finding and responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities in its hardware, APIs, and the mobile apps.

Meanwhile, on the same day, The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against D-Link, another large networking equipment providers, arguing that the company failed to implement necessary security protection in its routers and Internet-connected security cameras that left "thousands of consumers at risk" to hacking attacks.

If you are a bug bounty hunter, you should read all terms and conditions before shooting your exploits against Netgear products or website.

One of them explicitly mentioned, "You may only exploit, investigate, or target security bugs against your own accounts and/or your own devices. Testing must not violate any law, or disrupt or compromise any data or access data that is not yours; intentional access of customer data other than your own is prohibited."
The company is paying out up to $15,000 for each vulnerability. The highest bounty will be given for the flaws that would allow access to the cloud storage video files or live video feeds of all its customers, and bugs that allow remote access to routers from the Internet, as shown in the chart above.


However, the Netgear will also pay $10,000 for video feed and cloud storage access bugs that cannot be exploited in mass attacks. The same payout will also be given for security issues that provide access to the payment card data of all Netgear customers.

Others vulnerabilities that qualify the bounty program include:

SQL injection bug
Information disclosure flaw
Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) bug
Open redirect issues

Here's the Bingo! Bug bounty hunters will be rewarded with a triple prize if they will successfully exploit at least three flaws in a chain.

So, what are you waiting for? Go and Grab 'em all!

Again bad news for consumers with Netgear routers: Netgear routers hit by another serious security vulnerability, but this time more than two dozens router models are affected.

Security researchers from Trustwave are warning of a new authentication vulnerability in at least 31 models of Netgear models that potentially affects over one million Netgear customers.

The new vulnerability, discovered by Trustwave's SpiderLabs researcher Simon Kenin, can allow remote hackers to obtain the admin password for the Netgear router through a flaw in the password recovery process.

Kenin discovered the flaw (CVE-2017-5521) when he was trying to access the management page of his Netgear router but had forgotten its password.


Exploiting the Bug to Take Full Access on Affected Routers


So, the researcher started looking for ways to hack his own router and found a couple of exploits from 2014 that he leveraged to discover this flaw which allowed him to query routers and retrieve their login credentials easily, giving him full access to the device.

But Kenin said the newly discovered flaw could be remotely exploited only if the router's remote management option is enabled.

While the router vendor claims the remote management option is turned off on its routers by default, according to the researcher, there are "hundreds of thousands, if not over a million" routers left remotely accessible.

"The vulnerability can be used by a remote attacker if remote administration is set to be internet facing. By default this is not turned on," Kenin said. "However, anyone with physical access to a network with a vulnerable router can exploit it locally. This would include public Wi-Fi spaces like caf√©s and libraries using the vulnerable equipment."
If exploited by bad actors, the vulnerability that completely bypasses any password on a Netgear router could give hackers complete control of the affected router, including the ability to change its configuration, turn it into botnets or even upload entirely new firmware.

After trying out his flaw on a range of Netgear routers, Kenin was surprised to know that more than ten thousand vulnerable devices used the flawed firmware and can be accessed remotely.

He has also released an¬†exploit code¬†for testing purpose, written in Python.


List of Vulnerable NETGEAR Router Models

The SpiderLabs researcher stressed that the vulnerability is very serious as it affects a large number of Netgear router models. Here's a list of affected Netgear routers:

R8500
R8300
R7000
R6400
R7300DST

Update the Firmware of your NETGEAR Router Now!

Kenin notified Netgear of the flaw, and the company confirmed the issue affects a large number of its products.

Netgear has released firmware updates for all of its affected routers, and users are strongly advised to upgrade their devices.

This is the second time in around two months when researchers have discovered flaws in Netgear routers. Just last month, the US-CERT advised users to stop using Netgear's R7000 and R6400 routers due to a serious bug that permitted command injection.

However, in an effort to make its product safe, Netgear recently partnered up with<span class="highlight-match"> Bugcrowd </span>to launch a bug bounty program that can earn researchers cash rewards of up to $15,000 for finding and responsibly reporting flaws in its hardware, APIs, and the mobile apps.

Here's some bad news for Android users again.

Nearly 3 Million Android devices worldwide are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks that could allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code with root privileges, turning over full control of the devices to hackers.

According to a new report from security rating firm<span class="highlight-match"> BitSight,</span> the issue is due to a vulnerability in the insecure implementation of the OTA (Over-the-Air) update mechanism used by certain low-cost Android devices, including BLU Studio G from US-based Best Buy.


Backdoor/Rootkit Comes Pre-installed

The vulnerable OTA mechanism, which is associated with Chinese mobile firm Ragentek Group, contains a hidden binary ‚Äî resides as /system/bin/debugs ‚Äî that runs with root privileges and communicates over unencrypted channels with three hosts.

According to the researchers, this privileged binary not only exposes user-specific information to MITM attackers but also acts as a rootkit, potentially allowing attackers to remotely execute arbitrary commands on affected devices as a privileged user.

"Additionally, there are multiple techniques used to hide the execution of this binary. This behavior could be described as a rootkit," the CERT advisory associated with this vulnerability warned on Thursday.
Similar to the flaw discovered in Android devices running firmware from Shanghai ADUPS Technology, the newly discovered flaw (designated CVE-2016-6564) also resides in the firmware developed by a Chinese company.

While the AdUps firmware was caught stealing user and device information, the Ragentek firmware neither encrypt the communications sent and received to smartphones nor rely on code-signing to validate legitimate apps.

This blunder could allow a remote attacker to extract personal information from an affected device, remotely wiping the whole device, and even make it possible to gain access to other systems on a corporate network and steal sensitive data.


Affected Android Devices

The vulnerability has been found in multiple smartphone handsets from BLU Products, along with over a dozen devices from other vendors. The list of affected Android handsets includes:


BLU Studio G
BLU Studio G Plus
BLU Studio 6.0 HD
BLU Studio X
BLU Studio X Plus
BLU Studio C HD
Infinix Hot X507
Infinix Hot 2 X510
Infinix Zero X506
Infinix Zero 2 X509
DOOGEE Voyager 2 DG310
LEAGOO Lead 5
LEAGOO Lead 6
LEAGOO Lead 3i
LEAGOO Lead 2S
LEAGOO Alfa 6
IKU Colorful K45i
Beeline Pro 2
XOLO Cube 5.0


While analyzing the flaw, AnubisNetworks found that the device, a BLU Studio G, attempted to contact three pre-configured Internet domains, two of which remained unregistered despite being hardwired into the Ragentek firmware that introduced the bug.


"This OTA binary was distributed with a set of domains preconfigured in the software. Only one of these domains was registered at the time of the discovery of this issue," BitSight's subsidiary company Anubis Networks says in its report published Thursday.¬†

"If an adversary had noticed this, and registered these two domains, they would‚Äôve instantly had access to perform arbitrary attacks on almost 3,000,000 devices without the need to perform a man-in-the-middle attack."

After the discovery, AnubisNetworks researchers registered the addresses and now controls those two extraneous domains to this day in an attempt to prevent such attacks from occurring in the future.


Around 3 Million Devices contain Dangerous Rootkit

Still, the impact was significant. The researchers were able to exploit the backdoor in the BLU Studio G phone, which allowed them to install a file in the location that's reserved for apps with all-powerful system privileges.




However, by observing the data smartphones sent when connecting to the two domains registered by BitSight, the researchers have cataloged 55 known device models that are affected.

"We have observed over 2.8 Million distinct devices, across roughly 55 reported device models, which have checked into our sinkholes since we registered the extraneous domains," the report reads.¬†

"In some cases, we have not been [able] to translate the provided device model into a reference to the real-world device."
So far, only BLU Products has issued a software update to address the vulnerability, though BitSight researchers haven't yet tested the patch to analyze its effectiveness. However, the remaining Android devices might still be affected.

For more technical details about the vulnerability, you can head on to full report published by BitSight's AnubisNetworks.

This is the second case in a single week when researchers have warned you of Android smartphones coming pre-installed with backdoors that not only send massive amounts of your personal data to Chinese servers, but also allow hackers to take control of your device.

Here's some bad news for Android users again.

Certain low-cost Android smartphones and tablets are shipped with malicious firmware, which covertly gathers data about the infected devices, displays advertisements on top of running applications and downloads unwanted APK files on the victim's devices.

Security researchers from Russian antivirus vendor Dr.Web have discovered two types of downloader Trojans that have been incorporated in the firmware of a large number of popular Android devices operating on the MediaTek platform, which are mostly marketed in Russia.

The Trojans, detected as Android.DownLoader.473.origin and Android.Sprovider.7, are capable of collecting data about the infected devices, contacting their command-and-control servers, automatically updating themselves, covertly downloading and installing other apps based on the instructions it receives from their server, and running each time the device is restarted or turned on.

The list of Android device models that are affected by the malicious firmware includes:

Lenovo A319, Lenovo A6000, MegaFon Login 4 LTE, Bravis NB85, Bravis NB105, Irbis TZ85, Irbis TX97, Irbis TZ43, Irbis tz56, Pixus Touch 7.85 3G, SUPRA M72KG, SUPRA M729G, SUPRA V2N10, Itell K3300, Digma Plane 9.7 3G, General Satellite GS700, Nomi C07000, Optima 10.1 3G TT1040MG, Marshal ME-711, 7 MID, Explay Imperium 8, Perfeo 9032_3G, Prestigio MultiPad Wize 3021 3G, Prestigio MultiPad PMT5001 3G, Ritmix RMD-1121, Oysters T72HM 3G, Irbis tz70, and Jeka JK103.

"It is known that cybercriminals generate their income by increasing application download statistics and by distributing advertising software," the researchers pointed out. "Therefore, [both Trojans] were incorporated into Android firmware because dishonest outsourcers who took part in creation of Android system images decided to make money on users."




Android.Sprovider.7 Trojan was discovered in the firmware of Lenovo A319 and Lenovo A6000 smartphones. The Trojan is capable of doing a lot of things including:


Download, install and run APK files.
Open the specified link in a browser.
Make phone calls to certain numbers by using a standard system application.
Run a standard system phone application in which a specified number is already dialed.
Show advertisement on top of all apps.
Also, display advertisements in the status bar.
Create a shortcut on the home screen.
Update a major malicious module.


On the other hand, Android.DownLoader.473.origin found in the remaining devices, which downloads and installs other malware programs and unwanted apps, including an advertising program called H5GameCenter.

H5GameCenter app displays a small box image on top of all running applications, and there is no option to disable it. Even if the infected users remove this app, the firmware Trojan reinstalls the app.

Last month, security researchers from Kryptowire discovered hidden backdoor in the firmware of many budget Android smartphones sold in the US, which also covertly gathers data on phone owners and sends it to a Chinese server without users knowledge.

The backdoored firmware software was developed by China-based company Shanghai AdUps Technology, which claims that its software runs updates for more than 700 Million devices worldwide.

In separate research last month, security rating firm<span class="highlight-match"> BitSight </span>discovered a flaw in the Ragentek firmware used by certain low-cost Android devices that allowed attackers to remotely execute malicious code with root privileges, turning over full control of the devices to hackers.

Security researchers have discovered a new, massive cyber espionage campaign that mainly targets people working in government, defence and academic organisations in various countries.

The campaign is being conducted by an Iran-linked threat group, whose activities, attack methods, and targets have been released in a joint, detailed report published by researchers at Trend Micro and Israeli firm ClearSky.

Dubbed by researchers CopyKittens¬†(aka Rocket Kittens), the cyber espionage group has been active since at least 2013 and has targeted organisations and individuals, including diplomats and researchers, in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and Germany.

The targeted organisations include government institutions like Ministry of Foreign Affairs, defence companies, large IT companies, academic institutions, subcontractors of the Ministry of Defense, and municipal authorities, along with employees of the United Nations.

The latest report [PDF], dubbed "Operation Wilted Tulip," details an active espionage campaign conducted by the CopyKittens hackers, a vast range of tools and tactics they used, its command and control infrastructure, and the group's modus operandi.


How CopyKittens Infects Its Targets

The group used different tactics to infiltrate their targets, which includes watering hole attacks ‚Äî wherein JavaScript code is inserted into compromised websites to distribute malicious exploits.

The news media and organisations whose websites were abused as watering hole attacks include The Jerusalem Post, for which even German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) issued an alert, Maariv news and IDF Disabled Veterans Organization.

Besides water hole attacks, CopyKittens also used other methods to deliver malware, including:


Emailed links to malicious websites controlled by attackers.
Weaponized Office documents exploiting recently discovered flaw (CVE-2017-0199).
Web servers exploitation using vulnerability scanner and SQLi tools like Havij, sqlmap, and<span class="highlight-match"> Acunetix.</span>
Fake social media entities to build trust with targets and potentially spread malicious links.



"The group uses a combination of these methods to persistently target the same victim over multiple platforms until they succeed in establishing an initial beachhead of infection ‚Äì before pivoting to higher value targets on the network," Trend Micro writes in a blog post.
In order to infect its targets, CopyKittens makes use of its own custom malware tools in combination with existing, commercial tools, like Red Team software Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, post-exploitation agent Empire, TDTESS backdoor, and credential dumping tool Mimikatz.

Dubbed Matryoshka, the remote access trojan is the group's self-developed malware which uses DNS for command and control (C&C) communication and has the ability to steal passwords, capture screenshots, record keystrokes, collect and upload files, and give the attackers Meterpreter shell access.

"Matryoshka is spread through spear phishing with a document attached to it. The document has either a malicious macro that the victim is asked to enable or an embedded executable the victim is asked to open," Clear Sky says in a blog post.
The initial version of the malware was analysed in 2015 and seen in the wild from July 2016 until January 2017, though the group also developed and used Matryoshka version 2.

Users are recommended to enable two-factor authentication in order to protect their webmail accounts from being compromised, which is a treasure trove of information for hackers, and an "extremely strong initial beachhead" for pivoting into other targets.

A group of unknown hackers or an individual hacker may have breached voter registration databases for election systems in at least two US states, according to the FBI, who found evidence during an investigation this month.

Although any intrusion in the state voting system has not been reported, the FBI is currently investigating the cyberattacks on the official websites for voter registration system in both Illinois and Arizona, said Yahoo News.

The FBI's Cyber Division released a "Flash Alert" to election offices and officials across the United States, asking them to watch out for any potential intrusions and take better security precautions.

"In late June 2016, an unknown actor scanned a state's Board of Election website for vulnerabilities using<span class="highlight-match"> Acunetix,</span> and after identifying a Structured Query Language (SQL) injection (SQLi) vulnerability, used SQLmap to target the state website," the FBI alert reads.

"The majority of the data exfiltration occurred in mid-July. There were 7 suspicious IPs and penetration testing tools Acunetix, SQLMap, and DirBuster used by the actor."
The SQL injection attack on Illinois state board website took place in late July, which brought down the state‚Äôs voter registration for ten days and siphoned off data on as many as 200,000 registered voters.

However, the Arizona attack was less significant, as the hackers were not able to discover any potential loophole using a vulnerability scanning tool, which could have allowed them to steal any data successfully.

In the wake of these attacks, the FBI also advised ‚ÄòBoard of Elections‚Äô of all States to investigate their server logs and determine whether any similar SQL injection, privilege escalation attempts, or directory enumeration activity has occurred.

Last December, a misconfigured 300GB of the database also resulted in the exposure of around 191 Million US Voter records, including their full names, home addresses, unique voter IDs, date of births and phone numbers.


Why Blame Russia, Always? There's No Evidence Yet

The attacks against the state election boards came weeks after the DNC hack that leaked embarrassing emails about the party, leading to the resignation of DNC (Democratic National Committee) Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

Some security experts and law enforcement agencies raised concerns about politically motivated hacking, pointing finger over the Russian state-sponsored hackers in an attempt to damage Hillary Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign.

Although the FBI does not attribute the recent attacks to any particular hacking group or country, Yahoo News links the attacks to Russia on the basis of IP addresses involved.

However, those IP addresses that the FBI said were associated with the attacks belong to a Russian VPN service, which does not conclude that the Russians are behind the attacks.

It's believed that the hacks were carried out to disturb the election process either by altering voting totals in the database or by modifying the voter registration page.


Script-Kiddie Move Reveals Everything:

But, by scanning the website with a vulnerability scanner and downloading the whole database, the ‚Äòscript-kiddies‚Äô itself made a rod for their own back, which indicates that neither they are sophisticated state-sponsored hackers, nor they had any intention to influence the election covertly.

Neither the Illinois nor Arizona board of elections have responded to these hack attempts.

Those innocent-looking apps in your smartphone can secretly spy on your communications or could allow hackers to do so.

Hard to believe, but it's true.

Recently,<span class="highlight-match"> Trustwave'</span>s SpiderLabs analysts discovered a hidden backdoor in Skype for Apple's macOS and Mac OS X operating systems that could be used to spy on users' communications without their knowledge.

The backdoor actually resides in the desktop Application Programming Interface (API) that allows third-party plugins and apps to communicate with Microsoft-owned Skype ‚Äî the popular video chat and messaging service.

Appeared to have been around since at least 2010, the backdoor could allow any malicious third-party app to bypass authentication procedure and provide nearly complete access to Skype on Mac OS X.


How an Attacker can Take Complete Control of Your Skype


The malicious app could bypass authentication process if they "identified themselves as the program responsible for interfacing with the Desktop API on behalf of the Skype Dashboard widget program."

Accessing this backdoor is incredibly easy. All hackers need to do is change a text string in apps to this value ‚Üí "Skype Dashbd Wdgt Plugin," and the desktop API would provide access to sensitive features of Skype.

An attacker or any malicious program abusing this hidden backdoor could perform the following actions:

Read notifications of incoming messages (and their contents)
Intercept, read and modify messages
Log and record Skype call audio
Create chat sessions
Retrieve user contact information

The researchers have also provided proof-of-concept Objective-C code that initiates the connection process without asking the user for permission for the process to attach to Skype:

The backdoor believes to have been created by a developer at Skype before Microsoft acquired the company and likely exposed more than 30 Million Mac OS X users.


Update Your Skype Installation Now!

Trustwave notified Microsoft of the vulnerability in October, and the company has patched the issue in Skype 7.37 and later versions.

Here's what a Microsoft spokesperson said about the backdoor:

"We do not build backdoors into our products, but we do continuously improve the product experience [and] product security and encourage customers to always upgrade to the latest version."
Trustwave also speculated that the backdoor believed to have been accidently left in Skype "during the process of implementing the dashboard plugin," as the Skype dashboard widget does not appear to utilize it.

All versions of Skype for macOS and Mac OS X, including 7.35 version, are vulnerable. So users are strongly recommended to update their Skype installation as soon as possible.

Security researchers have recently uncovered a cyber espionage group targeting aerospace, defence and energy organisations in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea.

According to the latest research published Wednesday by US security firm FireEye, an Iranian hacking group that it calls Advanced Persistent Threat 33 (or APT33) has been targeting critical infrastructure, energy and military sectors since at least 2013 as part of a massive cyber-espionage operation to gather intelligence and steal trade secrets.

The security firm also says it has evidence that APT33 works on behalf of Iran's government.

FireEye researchers have spotted cyber attacks aimed by APT33 since at least May 2016 and found that the group has successfully targeted aviation sector‚Äîboth military and commercial‚Äîas well as organisations in the energy sector with a link to petrochemical.

The APT33 victims include a U.S. firm in the aerospace sector, a Saudi Arabian business conglomerate with aviation holdings, and a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals.

Most recently, in May 2017, APT33 targeted employees of a Saudi organisation and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice them with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company.

"We believe the targeting of the Saudi organisation may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea‚Äôs recent partnerships with Iran‚Äôs petrochemical industry as well as South Korea‚Äôs relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies," the FireEye report reads.

APT33 targets organisations by sending spear phishing emails with malicious HTML links to infect targets' computers with malware. The malware used by the espionage group includes DROPSHOT (dropper), SHAPESHIFT (wiper) and TURNEDUP (custom backdoor, which is the final payload).

However, in previous research published by Kaspersky, DROPSHOT was tracked by its researchers as StoneDrill, which targeted petroleum company in Europe and believed to be an updated version of Shamoon 2 malware.


"Although we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP backdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT," the report reads.

The SHAPESHIFT malware can wipe disks, erase volumes and delete files, depending on its configuration.

According to FireEye, APT 33 sent hundreds of spear phishing emails last year from several domains, which masqueraded as Saudi aviation companies and international organisations, including Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company and<span class="highlight-match"> Northrop Grumman </span>Aviation Arabia.

The security firm also believes APT 33 is linked to Nasr Institute, an Iranian government organisation that conducts cyber warfare operations.

In July, researchers at Trend Micro and Israeli firm ClearSky uncovered another Iranian espionage group, dubbed Rocket Kittens, that was also active since 2013 and targeted organisations and individuals, including diplomats and researchers, in Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and Germany.

However, FireEye report does not show any links between both the hacking group. For more technical details about the APT33 operations, you can head on to FireEye's official blog post.

A 21-year-old former Langley High School student, who won a Programmer of the Year Award in high school, pleaded guilty on Friday to charges of developing and selling custom key-logging malware that infected thousands of victims.

Zachary Shames from Virginia pleaded guilty in a federal district court and now faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison for his past deeds.

Shames was arrested this summer while he was working as a technical intern at<span class="highlight-match"> Northrop Grumman,</span> a security and defense government contractor, developing front-end site code and backend Java software and managing a MySQL database, according to what appears on his Linkedin page.

According to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice, Shames developed a keylogger in 2013 that allowed users to steal sensitive information, including passwords and banking credentials, from a victim's computer, while he was still a high school student in 2013.

Keylogger is malicious software designed to record every keystroke on a victim's computer.


Shames developed the first versions of now-defunct keylogger known as Limitless Logger Pro, which he sold for $35 on the infamous Hack Forums, according to an anonymous security researcher quoted by Motherboard.

Shames "continued to modify and market the illegal product from his college dorm room," at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va. and sold it to more than 3,000 people who, in turn, infected over 16,000 victims, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

The keylogger malware developed by Shames slowly turned out into a powerful tool. 

According to TrendMicro¬†(pdf), apart from key-logging, Limitless KeyLogger can also recover account names and passwords from many popular applications, such as Apple Safari, Firefox, Opera, Google Chrome, Bitcoin wallets, Core FTP, DynDNS, FileZilla, Internet Download Manager, Internet Explorer, Spotify, and more.

Shames pleaded guilty in an Alexandria courtroom, and Judge Liam O'Grady accepted his plea.

Shames now faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison and has been sentenced to be scheduled for June 16, 2017.

Another day, another data breach. This time one of the world's "big four" accountancy firms has fallen victim to a sophisticated cyber attack.

Global tax and auditing firm<span class="highlight-match"> Deloitte </span>has confirmed the company had suffered a cyber attack that resulted in the theft of confidential information, including the private emails and documents of some of its clients.

Deloitte is one of the largest private accounting firms in the U.S. which offers tax, auditing, operations consulting, cybersecurity advisory, and merger and acquisition assistance services to large banks, government agencies and large Fortune 500 multinationals, among others.

The global accountancy firm said Monday that its system had been accessed via an email platform from October last year through this past March and that "very few" of its clients had been affected, the Guardian reports.

The firm discovered the cyber attack in March, but it believes the unknown attackers may have had access to its email system since October or November 2016.

Hackers managed to gain access to the Deloitte's email server through an administrator account that wasn't secured using two-factor authentication (2FA), granting the attacker unrestricted access to Deloitte's Microsoft-hosted email mailboxes.

Besides emails, hackers also may have had potential access to "usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information."

"In response to a cyber incident, Deloitte implemented its comprehensive security protocol and began an intensive and thorough review including mobilising a team of cybersecurity and confidentiality experts inside and outside of Deloitte," a Deloitte spokesperson told the newspaper.

"As part of the review, Deloitte has been in contact with the very few clients impacted and notified governmental authorities and regulators."

Deloitte's internal investigation into the cyber incident is still ongoing, and the firm has reportedly informed only six of its clients that their information was "impacted" by the breach.

Deloitte has become the latest of the victim of the high-profile cyber attack. Just last month, Equifax publicly disclosed a breach of its systems that exposed personal data of as many as 143 million US customers.

Moreover, last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also disclosed that hackers managed to hack its financial document filing system and illegally profited from the stolen information.

Another day, another data breach. This time Amazon-owned grocery chain has fallen victim to a credit card security breach.

Whole Foods Market‚Äîacquired by Amazon for $13.7 billion in late August‚Äîdisclosed Thursday that hackers were able to gain unauthorized access to credit card information for its customers who made purchases at certain venues like taprooms and full table-service restaurants located within some stores.

Whole Foods Market has around 500 stores in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.

The company did not disclose details about the targeted locations or the total number of customers affected by the breach, but it did mention that hackers targeted some of its point-of-sale (POS) terminals in an attempt to steal customer data, including credit details.

The company also said people who only shopped for groceries at Whole Foods were not affected, neither the hackers were able to access Amazon transactions in the security breach.

Instead, only certain venues such as taprooms and table-service restaurants located within its stores‚Äîwhich use a separate POS system‚Äîwere impacted.

Whole Foods Market has hired a cybersecurity firm to help it investigate the credit card breach and contacted law enforcement authorities of this incident.
"When Whole Foods Market learned of this, the company launched an investigation, obtained the help of a leading cybersecurity forensics firm, contacted law enforcement, and is taking appropriate measures to address the issue," Whole Foods said in a statement on its website.The company is also encouraging its customers to closely monitor their credit card statements and "report any unauthorized charges to the issuing bank."

According to Whole Foods Market, none of the affected systems being investigated are, in any way, connected to Amazon.com systems.

Whole Foods Market has become the latest of the victim of the high-profile cyber attack. Earlier this month, Global tax and auditing firm<span class="highlight-match"> Deloitte </span>suffered a cyber attack that resulted in the theft of private emails and documents of some of its clients.

Also last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also disclosed that unknown hackers managed to hack its financial document filing system and illegally profited from the stolen information.

Last month, credit rating agency Equifax publicly disclosed a breach of its systems that exposed personal details, including names, addresses, birthdays and Social Security numbers, of potentially 143 million US customers.

	      4 Flaws hit HTTP/2 Protocol that could allow Hackers to Disrupt Servers [1.06 Points on average]

If you think that the HTTP/2 protocol is more secure than the standard HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), then you might be wrong, as it took researchers just four months to discover four flaws in the HTTP/2 protocol.

HTTP/2 was launched properly just in May last year after Google bundled its SPDY project into HTTP/2 in February in an effort to speed up the loading of web pages as well as the browsing experience of the online users.

Now, security researchers from data center security vendor<span class="highlight-match"> Imperva </span>today at Black Hat conference revealed details on at least four high-profile vulnerabilities in HTTP/2 ‚Äì a major revision of the HTTP network protocol that the today‚Äôs web is based on.

The vulnerabilities allow attackers to slow web servers by flooding them with innocent looking messages that carry a payload of gigabytes of data, putting the servers into infinite loops and even causing them to crash.

The HTTP/2 protocol can be divided into three layers:





The transmission layer that includes streams, frames and flow control
The HPACK binary encoding and compression protocol
The semantic layer ‚Äì an enhanced version of HTTP/1.1 enriched with server-push capabilities.


The researchers took an in-depth look at HTTP/2 server implementations from Apache, Microsoft, NGINX, Jetty, and nghttp2 and discovered exploitable flaws in all major HTTP/2 implementations, including two that are similar to well-known and widely exploited bugs in HTTP/1.x.


The four key vulnerabilities found in HTTP/2 include:


1. Slow Read (CVE-2016-1546)


This attack is identical to the well-known Slowloris DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack that major credit card processors experienced in 2010. The Slow Read attack calls on a malicious client to read responses very slowly.

The Slow Read attacks were well-studied in the HTTP/1.x ecosystem and they are still alive in the application layer of HTTP/2 implementations.

"The Imperva Defence Centre identified variants of this vulnerability across most popular web servers, including Apache, IIS, Jetty, NGINX and nghttp2," says Imperva.


2. HPACK Bomb (CVE-2016-1544, CVE-2016-2525)


HPACK Bomb is a compression layer attack that resembles a zip bomb attack or a 'decompression bomb'.

HPACK is used to reduce the size of packet headers. Basically, the sender can tell the receiver the maximum size of the header compression table used to decode the headers.

In this attack, a potential hacker creates small and innocent-looking messages that actually unpack into gigabytes of data on the server, thereby consuming all the server memory resources and effectively slowing down or crashing targeted systems.

Imperva created a header that was 4KB size -- the same size as the entire compression table. Then on the same connection, it opened up new streams with each stream that referred to the initial header as many times as possible (up to 16K of header references).

After sending 14 such streams, the connection consumed 896MB of server memory after decompression, which crashed the server, Imperva researchers explain.


3. Dependency Cycle Attack (CVE-2015-8659)


This attack leverages the flow control mechanisms that HTTP/2 uses for network optimization.

A bad intent client can use specially crafted requests to prompt a dependency cycle, thus forcing the server into an infinite loop.

The flaw could allow an attacker to cause Denial of Service (DoS) or even run arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.


4. Stream Multiplexing Abuse (CVE-2016-0150)


The attack allows an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the way servers implement the stream multiplexing functionality in order to crash the server. This attack eventually results in a denial of service (DoS) to legitimate users.

All the four vulnerabilities have already been fixed in HTTP/2, which is currently being used by some 85 Million websites, or around 9 percent of all websites, on the Internet, according to W3Techs.

Here's what Imperva co-founder and chief technology officer Amichai Shulman says:

"The general web performance improvements and specific enhancements for mobile applications introduced in HTTP/2 are a potential boon for internet users. However, releasing a large amount of new code into the wild in a short time creates an excellent opportunity for attackers."¬†

"While it is disturbing to see known HTTP 1.x threats introduced in HTTP/2, it‚Äôs hardly surprising. As with all new technology, it is important for businesses to perform due diligence and implement safeguards to harden the extended attack surface and protect critical business and consumer data from ever-evolving cyber threats."
The vulnerabilities took advantage of HTTP/2 features that were meant to reduce bandwidth use and round trips while speeding up the loading time of websites.

According to Imperva researchers, by implementing a web application firewall (WAF) with virtual patching capabilities can help enterprises to prevent their critical data and applications from cyber attack while introducing HTTP/2.

You can get more details of Imperva‚Äôs research in a report [PDF] dubbed "HTTP/2: In-depth analysis of the top four flaws of the next generation web protocol."

After Equifax massive data breach that was believed to be caused due to a vulnerability in Apache Struts, Cisco has initiated an investigation into its products that incorporate a version of the popular Apache Struts2 web application framework.

Apache Struts is a free, open-source MVC framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language, and used by 65 percent of the Fortune 100 companies, including Lockheed Martin, Vodafone, Virgin Atlantic, and the IRS.

However, the popular open-source software package was recently found affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including two remote code execution vulnerabilities‚Äîone discovered earlier this month, and another in March‚Äîone of which is believed to be used to breach personal data of over 143 million Equifax users.

Some of Cisco products including its Digital Media Manager, MXE 3500 Series Media Experience Engines, Network Performance Analysis, Hosted Collaboration Solution for Contact Center, and Unified Contact Center Enterprise¬†have¬†been¬†found vulnerable to multiple Apache Struts flaws.


Cisco Launches Apache Struts Vulnerability Hunting

Cisco is also testing rest of its products against four newly discovered security vulnerability in Apache Struts2, including the one (CVE-2017-9805) we reported on September 5 and the remaining three also disclosed last week.

However, the remote code execution bug (CVE-2017-5638) that was actively exploited back in March this year is not included by the company in its recent security audit.

The three vulnerabilities‚ÄîCVE-2017-9793, CVE-2017-9804 and CVE-2017-9805‚Äîincluded in the Cisco security audit was released by the Apache Software Foundation on 5th September with the release of Apache Struts 2.5.13 which patched the issues.

The fourth vulnerability (CVE-2017-12611) that is being investigated by Cisco was released on 7th September with the release of Apache Struts 2.3.34 that fixed the flaw that resided in the Freemarker tag functionality of the Apache Struts2 package and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute malicious code on an affected system.


Apache Struts Flaw Actively Exploited to Hack Servers & Deliver Malware

Coming on to the most severe of all, CVE-2017-9805 (assigned as critical) is a programming bug that manifests due to the way Struts REST plugin handles XML payloads while deserializing them.

This could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution on a host running a vulnerable version of Apache Struts2, and Cisco's Threat intelligence firm Talos has¬†observed¬†that this flaw is¬†under active exploitation¬†to find vulnerable servers.

Security researchers from data centre security vendor<span class="highlight-match"> Imperva </span>recently detected and blocked thousands of attacks attempting to exploit this Apache Struts2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-9805), with roughly 80 percent of them tried to deliver a malicious payload.

The majority of attacks originated from China with a single Chinese IP address registered to a Chinese e-commerce company sending out more than 40% of all the requests. Attacks also came from Australia, the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Russia and various parts of Europe.

Out of the two remaining flaws, one (CVE-2017-9793) is again a vulnerability in the REST plug-in for Apache Struts that manifests due to "insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the XStream library in the REST plug-in for the affected application."

This flaw has been given a Medium severity and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on targeted systems.

The last flaw (CVE-2017-9804) also allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system but resides in the URLValidator feature of Apache Struts.

Cisco is testing its products against these vulnerabilities including its WebEx Meetings Server, the Data Center Network Manager, Identity Services Engine (ISE), MXE 3500 Series Media Experience Engines, several Cisco Prime products, some products for voice and unified communications, as well as video and streaming services.

At the current, there are no software patches to address the vulnerabilities in Cisco products, but the company promised to release updates for affected software which will soon be accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool.

Since the framework is being widely used by a majority of top 100 fortune companies, they should also check their infrastructures against these vulnerabilities that incorporate a version of Apache Struts2.

Not just that, Microsoft partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu on Windows 10, worked with FreeBSD to develop a Virtual Machine image for its Azure cloud, and chosen Ubuntu as the OS for its Cloud-based Big Data services.


And the big news for this year is‚Ä¶

At its 2016 Connect developer event in New York today, Microsoft announced that the company is joining the Linux Foundation as a Platinum member ‚Äì the highest level of membership, which costs $500,000 annually.

Besides this, Microsoft also announced that tech giant Google has also joined on with the independent .NET Foundation.

The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit organization that oversees the development of the very popular free operating system Linux, alongside advances open technology development as well as commercial adoption.

Microsoft has already contributed to a number of its open source projects, including Node.js Foundation, Open Container Initiative, OpenDaylight, R Consortium, and Open API Initiative.

However, today's announcement from Microsoft still comes as a surprise to many, as Former Microsoft Chief Steve Ballmer once said, "Linux is a cancer,"¬†in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times.

Here's what Microsoft said in its latest announcement for joining the Linux Foundation:


"As part of its effort to work more closely with the open source community, Microsoft on Wednesday announced it has joined the Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member. Microsoft's membership in the Linux Foundation will benefit customers through increased collaboration and innovation among a diverse ecosystem."

Microsoft believes its latest move will benefit its customers through increased collaboration and innovation.

Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, also acknowledged the company's move to work more closely with the open-source community, saying:


"By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people. Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development."

Other Linux Foundation Platinum members include Cisco, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Oracle, Qualcomm, Samsung, Fujitsu,<span class="highlight-match"> HPE,</span> and NEC. While Gold sponsors include Google, Facebook and more than a dozen other prominent open source users.

In an effort to expand its certificate authority capabilities and build the "foundation of a more secure web," Google has finally launched its root certificate authority.

In past few years, we have seen Google taking many steps to show its strong support for sites using HTTPS, like:

Giving more preference to HTTPS websites in its search rankings than others.


Warning users that all HTTP pages are not secure.
Starting an industry-wide initiative, Certificate Transparency ‚àí an open framework to log, audit, and monitor certificates that CAs have issued.



However, Google has been relying on an intermediate Certificate Authority (Google Internet Authority G2 - GIAG2) issued by a third party, with the latest suppliers being<span class="highlight-match"> GlobalSign </span>and GeoTrust, which manages and deploys certificates to Google's products and services.

Google announced Thursday the creation of its own certified, and independent Root Certificate Authority called Google Trust Services, allowing the company to issue its own TLS/SSL certificates for securing its web traffic via HTTPS, instead of relying on third party certs.


"As we look forward to the evolution of both the web and our own products it is clear HTTPS will continue to be a foundational technology," writes Ryan Hurst, product manager at Google, in a blog post. "This is why we have made the decision to expand our current Certificate Authority efforts to include the operation of our own Root Certificate Authority."

The newly established Google Trust Services (GTS) will issue certificates on behalf of Google and parent company Alphabet.

Like others, Google Trust Services can now be used to sign other subordinate certificates to authenticate the identity of other websites.

However, the process of embedding root CAs into products can take time, so Google acquired two existing Root Certificate Authorities from GlobalSign: R2 and R4.

The acquisitions will allow independent certificate issuance from the company "sooner rather than later."

Developers, who will have to include the new Root Certificates into their services, can head to the Google's official announcement for more details about the newly established Google Trust Services (GTS).

Yesterday WikiLeaks published thousands of documents revealing top CIA hacking secrets, including the agency's ability to break into iPhones, Android phones, smart TVs, and Microsoft, Mac and Linux operating systems.

It dubbed the first release as Vault 7.

Vault 7 is just the first part of leak series ‚ÄúYear Zero‚Äù that WikiLeaks will be releasing in coming days. Vault 7 is all about a covert global hacking operation being run by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

According to the whistleblower organization, the CIA did not inform the companies about the security issues of their products; instead held on to security bugs in software and devices, including iPhones, Android phones, and Samsung TVs, that millions of people around the world rely on.

One leaked document suggested that the CIA was even looking for tools to remotely control smart cars and trucks, allowing the agency to cause "accidents" which would effectively be "nearly undetectable assassinations."

While security experts, companies and non-profit organizations are still reviewing 8,761 documents released as Vault 7 archive, we are here with some relevant facts and points that you need to know.

Here's Everything You Need to Know About Vault 7:

WikiLeaks Exposes CIA's Mobile Hacking SecretsVault7 ‚Äî CIA has an impressive list of ways to hack into your iOS, Android & Windows phones.
CLICK TO TWEETVault 7 purportedly includes 8,761 documents and files that detail intelligence information on CIA-developed software intended to crack any Android smartphone or Apple iPhone, including some that could take full control of the devices.

In fact, Wikileaks alleges that the CIA has a sophisticated unit in its Mobile Development Branch that develops zero-day exploits and malware to "infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads."

Some of the attacks are powerful enough to allow an attacker to remotely take over the "kernel," the heart of the operating system that controls the smartphone operation, or to gain "root" access on the devices, giving the attacker access to information like geolocation, communications, contacts, and more.

These types of attacks would most likely be useful for targeted hacking, rather than mass surveillance.

The leaked documents also detail some specific attacks the agency can perform on certain smartphones models and operating systems, including recent versions of iOS and Android.

CIA Didn't Break Encryption Apps, Instead Bypassed ItVault7 ‚Äî CIA-made phone malware can read your private chats without breaking encryption.CLICK TO TWEETIn the hours since the documents were made available by WikiLeaks, a misconception was developed, making people believe the CIA "cracked" the encryption used by popular secure messaging software including Signal and WhatsApp.

WikiLeaks asserted that:
"These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloakman by hacking the "smart" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied."This statement by WikiLeaks made most people think that the encryption used by end-to-end encrypted messaging clients such as Signal and WhatsApp has been broken.

No, it hasn't.

Instead, the CIA has tools to gain access to entire phones, which would of course "bypass" encrypted messaging apps because it fails all other security systems virtually on the phone, granting total remote access to the agency.

The WikiLeaks documents do not show any attack particular against Signal or WhatsApp, but rather the agency hijacks the entire phone and listens in before the applications encrypt and transmit information.

It‚Äôs like you are sitting in a train next to the target and reading his 2-way text conversation on his phone or laptop while he's still typing, this doesn't mean that the security of the app the target is using has any issue.

In that case, it also doesn't matter if the messages were encrypted in transit if you are already watching everything that happens on the device before any security measure comes into play.

But this also doesn't mean that this makes the issue lighter, as noted by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, "This incorrectly implies CIA hacked these apps/encryption. But the docs show iOS/Android are what got hacked‚Äîa much bigger problem."

CIA Develops Malware to targets Windows, Linux & MacOSVault7 ‚Äî CIA also develops cross-platform malware to hack Windows, MacOS & Linux ComputersCLICK TO TWEETThe Wikileaks CIA dump also includes information about the malware that can be used by the agency to hack, remotely spy on and control PCs running Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

This apparently means that the CIA can bypass PGP email encryption and even Virtual Private Network (VPN) on your computer in a similar way. The agency can also see everything you are doing online, even if you are hiding it behind Tor Browser. 

Again, this also does not mean that using PGP, VPNs, or Tor Browser is not safe or that the CIA can hack into these services.

But the agency's ability to hack into any OS to gain full control of any device  ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a smartphone, a laptop, or a TV with a microphone ‚Äî makes the CIA capable of bypassing any service spy on everything that happens on that device.

CIA Borrowed Codes from Public Malware SamplesVault7 ‚Äî CIA uses codes from publicly available #malware samples to build its own spyware.CLICK TO TWEETYes, in addition to the attacks purportedly developed by the CIA, the agency has adopted some of the code from other, public sources of malware. Well, that's what many does.

One of the documents mentions how the agency supposedly tweaks bits of code from known malware samples to develop its custom code and more targeted solutions.

"The UMBRAGE team maintains a library of application development techniques borrowed from in-the-wild malware," the WikiLeaks document reads. "The goal of this repository is to provide functional code snippets that can be rapidly combined into custom solutions."
Some of the exploits listed were discovered and released by security firms, hacker groups, independent researchers, and purchased, or otherwise acquired by the CIA from other intelligence agencies, such as the FBI, NSA, and GCHQ.

One borrowed exploit in "Data Destruction Components" includes a reference to Shamoon, a nasty malware that has the capability to steal data and then completely wipe out hard-drives.

Another acquired attack by the CIA is SwampMonkey, which allows the agency to get root privileges on undisclosed Android devices.

Persistence, another tool in the CIA arsenal, allows the agency to gain control over the target device whenever it boots up again.

CIA Used Malware-Laced Apps to Spy on TargetsVault7 ‚Äî Fine Dining Attack: CIA used #malware-laced apps to spy on its targets.CLICK TO TWEETThe leaked documents include a file, named "Fine Dining," which does not contain any list of zero-day exploits or vulnerabilities, but a collection of malware-laced applications.

Fine Dining is a highly versatile technique which can be configured for a broad range of deployment scenarios, as it is meant for situations where the CIA agent has to infect a computer physically.

CIA field agents store one or more of these infected applications -- depending upon their targets -- on a USB, which they insert in their target's system to run one of the applications to gather the data from the device.

Developed by OSB (Operational Support Branch), a division of the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, Fine Dining includes modules that can be used to weaponize following applications:

The CIA's Desperation To Crack Apple's EncryptionVault7 ‚Äî CIA has desperately been working for years to break Apple's Encryption.CLICK TO TWEETThis is not the first time when the CIA has been caught targeting iOS devices. It was previously disclosed that the CIA was targeting Apple's iPhones and iPads, following the revelation of top-secret documents from the agency's internal wiki system in 2015 from the Snowden leaks.

The documents described that the CIA had been "targeting essential security keys used to encrypt data stored on Apple's devices" by using both "physical" and "non-invasive" techniques.

In addition to the CIA, the FBI hacking division Remote Operations Unit has also been working desperately to discover exploits in iPhones, one of the WikiLeaks documents indicates.

That could also be the reason behind the agency's effort to force Apple into developing a working exploit to hack into the iPhone belonging to one of the terrorists in the San Bernardino case.

Apple Says It Has Already Patched Most Flaws Documented in CIA LeakVault7 ‚Äî Apple says it has already patched many iOS vulnerabilities revealed in CIA Leaks.CLICK TO TWEETBesides vulnerabilities in Android and Samsung Smart TVs, the leaked documents detail 14 iOS exploits, describing how the agency uses these security issues to track users, monitor their communications, and even take complete control of their phones.

However, Apple is pushing back against claims that the CIA's stored bugs for its devices were effective.

According to Apple, many iOS exploits in the Wikileaks CIA document dump have already been patched in its latest iOS version, released in January, while Apple engineers continue to work to address any new vulnerabilities that were known to the CIA.

Here's the statement provided by an Apple spokesperson:
"Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers‚Äô privacy and security. The technology built into today‚Äôs iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we‚Äôre constantly working to keep it that way. Our products and software are designed to quickly get security updates into the hands of our customers, with nearly 80 percent of users running the latest version of our operating system. While our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities. We always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates."Hacking 'Anyone, Anywhere,' Thanks to Internet Of 'Insecure' ThingsVault7 ‚Äî CIA can hack your Smart TV and other smart devices to spy on you.CLICK TO TWEETBesides hundreds of exploits, zero-days, and hacking tools that targets a large number of software and services, Vault 7 also includes details about a surveillance technique ‚Äî codenamed Weeping Angel ‚Äî used by the CIA to infiltrate smart TVs.

Samsung smart TVs are found to be vulnerable to Weeping Angel hacks that place the TVs into a "Fake-Off" mode, in which the owner believes the TV is off when it is actually on, allowing the CIA to covertly record conversations "in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server."

"Weeping Angel already hooks key presses from the remote (or TV goes to sleep) to cause the system to enter Fake-Off rather than Off," the leaked CIA document reads. "Since the implant is already hooking these events, the implant knows when the TV will be entering Fake-Off mode."

In response to the WikiLeaks CIA documents, Samsung released a statement that reads: "Protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung. We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter."

WikiLeaks' CIA Leak Isn't Bigger than Snowden's NSA LeaksThe CIA isn't more advanced than the NSA TAO Team and Vault 7 leak isn‚Äôt even bigger than Snowden .CLICK TO TWEETWikiLeaks claims the massive CIA hacking leak is larger than the Edward Snowden revelations about NSA's hacking and surveillance programs, but it is much much smaller.

While the Snowden revelations disclosed the global covert surveillance through text, the voice of people using hacking tools that permitted mass data gathering and analysis, the CIA data dump so far just shows that the CIA gathered and purchased tools that could be used to target individual devices.

However, there is no evidence of mass surveillance of smartphones or computers in the leaked documents. Technologically, the NSA is much more forward in sophistication and technical expertise than the CIA.
Ex-CIA Chief Says Wikileaks dump has made US 'less safe'Vault7 ‚Äî Ex-CIA Chief says CIA files leaked by Wikileaks is incredibly damaging and has put lives at risk.CLICK TO TWEETFormer CIA boss Michael Hayden said the latest leak of highly sensitive CIA documents and files by Wikileaks is "incredibly damaging" and has put lives at risk, BBC reports, while the CIA has not yet commented on the leaks.

The CIA revelations by the whistleblower organization are just beginning. People will see more revelations about the government and agencies from the WikiLeaks in coming days as part of its Year Zero leaks.

Gift cards have once again caused quite a headache for retailers, as cyber criminals are using a botnet to break into and steal cash from money-loaded gift cards provided by major retailers around the globe.

Dubbed GiftGhostBot, the new botnet specialized in gift card fraud is an advanced persistent bot (APB) that has been spotted in the wild by cyber security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Distil Networks.</span>

GiftGhostBot has been seen attacking almost 1,000 websites worldwide and defrauding legitimate consumers of the money loaded on gift cards since Distil detected the attack late last month.

According to the security firm, any website ‚Äì from luxury retailers, supermarkets to coffee distributors ‚Äì that allow their customers to buy products with gift cards could be targeted by the botnet.

Operators of the GiftGhostBot botnet launch brute-force attacks against retailer's website to check potential gift card account numbers at a rate of about 1.7 Million numbers per hour, and request the balance for each number.


Once the gift card account number and its balance is correctly matched, the fraudsters automatically get logged into that account without any authentication.

The cyber criminals then record those account numbers to either resell them on the Dark Web or use them to purchase goods.

What's interesting? The beauty of stealing money from gift cards, according to the security firm, is that "it is typically anonymous and untraceable once stolen."

Like any other sophisticated cyberattack, the GiftGhostBots botnets are also being distributed across the global hosting providers, internet service providers, and data centers, executing JavaScript mimicking a regular browser to evade detection.

"Like most sophisticated bot attacks, GiftGhostBot operators are moving quickly to evade detection, and any retailer that offers gift cards could be under attack at this very moment," said Distil Networks CEO Rami Essaid. "To prevent resources from being drained, individuals and companies must work together to prevent further damage."


Here's How to Protect Yourself:

Since retailers are not exposing consumers' personal information, users are strongly recommended to remain vigilant.


Check your gift card balances and take a screenshot of the page showing your account balance as proof.
Don‚Äôt forget your gift cards and leave it unused. Treat them like cash and use them to prevent fraud.
Contact retailers and ask for more information if facing problems with cards.
Inserting a CAPTCHA can help retailers prevent many bots (while not the sophisticated ones but many).
Retailers should monitor their web traffic regularly to identify any attack. While sophisticated bots constantly rotate their IP address to evade detection, Distil has provided known IP addresses involved in the attack.
Retailers can also put rate limits on requests to the check your balance page.

Do you believe that just because you have downloaded an app from the official app store, you're safe from malware?

Think twice before believing it.

A team of security researchers from several security firms have uncovered a new, widespread botnet that consists of tens of thousands of hacked Android smartphones.

Dubbed WireX, detected as "Android Clicker," the botnet network primarily includes infected Android devices running one of the hundreds of malicious apps installed from Google Play Store and is designed to conduct massive application layer DDoS attacks.

Researchers from different Internet technology and security companies‚Äîwhich includes Akamai, CloudFlare, Flashpoint, Google, Oracle Dyn,<span class="highlight-match"> RiskIQ,</span> Team Cymru‚Äîspotted a series of cyber attacks earlier this month, and they collaborated to combat it.

Although Android malware campaigns are quite common these days and this newly discovered campaign is also not that much sophisticated, I am quite impressed with the way multiple security firms‚Äîwhere half of them are competitors‚Äîcame together and shared information to take down a botnet.


WireX botnet was used to launch minor DDoS attacks earlier this month, but after mid-August, the attacks began to escalate.

The "WireX" botnet had already infected over 120,000 Android smartphones at its peak earlier this month, and on 17th August, researchers noticed a massive DDoS attack (primarily HTTP GET requests) originated from more than 70,000 infected mobile devices from over 100 countries.

If your website has been DDoSed, look for the following pattern of User-Agent strings to check if it was WireX botnet: 


After further investigation, security researchers identified more than 300 malicious apps on Google‚Äôs official Play Store, many of which purported to be media, video players, ringtones, or tools for storage managers and app stores, which include the malicious WireX code.

Just like many malicious apps, WireX apps do not act maliciously immediately after the installation in order to evade detection and make their ways to Google Play Store.

Instead, WireX apps wait patiently for commands from its command and control servers located at multiple subdomains of "axclick.store."

Google has identified and already blocked most of 300 WireX apps, which were mostly downloaded by users in Russia, China, and other Asian countries, although the WireX botnet is still active on a small scale.


If your device is running a newer version of the Android operating system that includes Google's Play Protect feature, the company will automatically remove WireX apps from your device, if you have one installed.

Play Protect is Google's newly launched security feature that uses machine learning and app usage analysis to remove (uninstall) malicious apps from users Android smartphones to prevent further harm.

Also, it is highly recommended to install apps from reputed and verified developers, even when downloading from Google official Play Store and avoid installing unnecessary apps.

Additionally, you are strongly advised to always keep a good antivirus app on your mobile device that can detect and block malicious apps before they can infect your device, and always keep your device and apps up-to-date.

Android malware continues to evolve with more sophisticated and never-seen-before attack vectors and capabilities with every passing day.

Just at the beginning of this week, Google removed over 500 Android apps utilising the rogue SDK‚Äîthat secretly distribute spyware to users‚Äîfrom its Play Store marketplace.

Last month, we also saw first Android malware with code injecting capabilities making rounds on Google Play Store.

A few days after that, researchers discovered another malicious Android SDK ads library, dubbed "Xavier," found installed on more than 800 different apps that had been downloaded millions of times from Google Play Store.

Yes, you only need a single laptop with a decent internet connection, rather a massive botnet, to launch overwhelming denial of service (DoS) attacks in order to bring down major Internet servers and modern-day firewalls.

Researchers at TDC Security Operations Center have discovered a new attack technique that lone attackers with limited resources (in this case, a laptop and at least 15Mbps of bandwidth) can use to knock large servers offline.

Dubbed a BlackNurse attack or the low-rate "Ping of Death" attack, the technique can be used to launch several low-volume DoS attacks by sending specially formed Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets, or 'pings' that overwhelm the processors on server protected by firewalls from Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, among others.

ICMP is a protocol used by routers and other networking devices to send and receive error messages.

According to a technical report [PDF] published this week, the BlackNurse attack is more traditionally known as a "ping flood attack" and is based on ICMP Type 3 (Destination Unreachable) Code 3 (Port Unreachable) requests.

These requests are packet replies typically returned to ping sources when the destination port of a target is 'unreachable.'


Here's How the BlackNurse attack Works:

By sending a Type 3 ICMP packets with a code of 3, a hacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) state by overloading the CPUs of certain types of server firewalls, regardless of the quality of internet connection.

The BlackNurse traffic volume is very small, ranging from 15 Mbps to 18 Mbps (or about 40,000 to 50,000 packets per second), which is laughable compared to record-breaking 1.1 Tbps DDoS attack recorded against French Internet service provider OVH in September.

However, TDC explained this was not the problem, as the major issue is a steady stream of 40K to 50K ICMP packets that reach the victim's network equipment and keep crashing the target device.

The good news? The researcher said, "When an attack is ongoing, users from the LAN side will no longer be able to send/receive traffic to/from the Internet. All firewalls we've have seen recover when the attack stops."

In other words, this low-volume DoS technique remains effective because it is not flooding the firewall with traffic, but rather it is pushing high load onto the CPU, effectively knocking servers offline even if they've tons of network capacity.

Researchers said BlackNurse should not be confused with 'ping flood attacks based on ICMP Type 8 Code 0' ‚Äì regular ping traffic. Researchers explain:

"The BlackNurse attack attracted our attention because in our anti-DDoS solution we experienced that even though traffic speed and packets per second were very low, this attack could keep our customers' operations down."¬†

"This even applied to customers with large internet uplinks and large enterprise firewalls in place. We had expected that professional firewall equipment would be able to handle the attack."


Products Affected

The BlackNurse attack works against the following products:

Cisco ASA 5506, 5515, 5525 (default settings)
Cisco ASA 5550 (legacy) and 5515-X (latest generation)
Cisco Router 897 (can be mitigated)<span class="highlight-match">
SonicWall </span>(misconfiguration can be changed and mitigated)
Some unverified Palo Alto
Zyxel NWA3560-N (wireless attack from LAN side)
Zyxel Zywall USG50


How to Mitigate the BlackNurse Attack?

The good news? There are ways to fight back the BlackNurse attacks.

TDC suggested some mitigations and SNORT IDS rules that could be used to detect BlackNurse attacks. Moreover, proof-of-concept (PoC) code posted by an OVH security engineer on GitHub can also be used by network admins to test their equipment against BlackNurse.

In order to mitigate the BlackNurse attacks on firewalls and other equipment, TDC recommended users to configure a list of trusted sources for which ICMP is allowed. However, the best way to mitigate the attack is to simply disable ICMP Type 3 Code 3 on the WAN interface.

Palo Alto Networks has also issued an advisory, saying that its devices are only affected in "very specific, non-default scenarios that contravene best practices." The company also lists some recommendations for its customers.

Meanwhile, Cisco said it does not consider the reported behavior to be a security issue, warning:

"We recommend that you grant permission for the ICMP unreachable message type (type 3). Denying ICMP unreachable messages disables ICMP Path MTU discovery, which can halt IPSec and PPTP traffic."
Moreover, independent software vendor NETRESEC also published a detailed analysis of BlackNurse in its post titled, "The 90's called and wanted their ICMP flood attack back."

Besides all these, the Sans Institute has also issued its own brief write-up on the BlackNurse attack, discussing the attack and what users should do in order to mitigate it.

Adobe may kill Flash Player by the end of 2020, but until then, the company would not stop providing security updates to the buggy software.

As part of its monthly security updates, Adobe has released patches for eight security vulnerabilities in its three products, including two vulnerabilities in Flash Player, four in ColdFusion, and two in RoboHelp‚Äîfive of these are rated as critical.

Both of the Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities can be exploited for remote code execution on the affected device, and both have been classified as critical.

None of the patched vulnerabilities has reportedly been exploited in the wild, according to the company.

The critical Flash Player flaws are tracked as CVE-2017-11281 and CVE-2017-11282 and were discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk and Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero, respectively.

Both the security vulnerabilities are memory corruption issues that could lead to remote code execution and affect all major operating system, including Windows, Macintosh, Linux and Chrome OS.

The vulnerabilities have been updated in the latest Flash Player version 27.0.0.130.

The remaining three critical and one important flaw reside in Cold Fusion, including a critical XML parsing flaw (CVE-2017-11286), an important XSS (cross-site scripting) bug (CVE-2017-11285) that could lead to information disclosure and mitigation for unsafe Java deserialization, resulting in remote code execution (CVE-2017-11283, CVE-2017-11284).

These vulnerabilities affect all platforms and have been discovered and reported by Nick Bloor of<span class="highlight-match"> NCC Group,</span> Daniel Sayk of Telekom Security and Daniel Lawson of Depth Security.

The issues have been patched in the latest Adobe ColdFusion version 2016 Release Update 5 and version 11 Update 13.

The rest of the two flaws‚Äîone important (CVE-2017-3104) and one rated moderate (CVE-2017-3105)‚Äîaffects Windows version of Adobe‚Äôs help authoring tool RoboHelp.

The important bug is an input validation flaw that could allow for a DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, while the moderate-severity invalidated URL redirect vulnerability could be used in phishing campaigns to deliver malware.

The vulnerabilities have been patched in the latest Adobe RoboHelp version RH2017.0.2 and RH12.0.4.460 (Hotfix).

Although no exploits for these patched vulnerabilities have been spotted in the wild by the company, users are strongly advised to patch their software as soon as possible to protect themselves from any remote attack.

Do you use<span class="highlight-match"> OneLogin </span>password manager? If yes, then immediately change all your account passwords right now.

OneLogin, the cloud-based password management and identity management software company, has admitted that the company has suffered a data breach.

The company announced on Thursday that it had "detected unauthorised access" in its United States data region.

Although the company did not provide many details about the nature of the cyber attack, the statement released by the firm suggest that the data breach is extensive.

What Happened? OneLogin, which aims at offering a service that "secures connections across all users, all devices, and every application," has not yet revealed potential weaknesses in its service that may have exposed its users‚Äô data in the first place.

"Today We detected unauthorised access to OneLogin data in our US data region," OneLogin chief information security officer Alvaro Hoyos said in a brief blog post-Wednesday night.
What type of Information? Although it is not clear exactly what data has been stolen in the hack, a detailed post on a support page that is accessible to customers only, apparently says that all customers served by the company's US data centre are affected, whose data has been compromised.

The stolen data also includes "the ability to decrypt encrypted data."

What is OneLogin doing? OneLogin has blocked the unauthorised access to its data centre and is actively working with law enforcement and security firm to investigate the incident and verify the extent of the impact.

"We have since blocked this unauthorised¬†access, reported the matter to law enforcement, and are working with an independent security firm to determine how the unauthorised¬†access happened and verify the extent of the impact of this incident," Hoyos said.

"We are actively working to determine how best to prevent such an incident from occurring in the future."

What Should You Do Now? First of all, change passwords for all your accounts that you have linked with OneLogin.

The company has given customers an extensive list of actions to do to protect themselves and minimise the risk to their data, which includes:

Forcing a password reset for all of its customers.
Generating new security credentials, OAuth tokens, and certificates for apps and websites.
Recycling secrets stored in OneLogin's secure notes.

For any other queries, OneLogin customers can contact the company at security-support@onelogin.com.

You should also particularly be alert of the Phishing emails, which are usually the next step of cyber criminals after a breach. Phishing is designed to trick users into giving up further details like passwords and bank information.

This is the second data breach the company has suffered within a year. In August 2016, a OneLogin suffered a separate data breach in which an unauthorized hacker gained access to one of the company‚Äôs standalone systems, which it used for "log storage and analytics."

Security researchers are warning of a new, easy-to-exploit email trick that could allow an attacker to turn a seemingly benign email into a malicious one after it has already been delivered to your email inbox.

Dubbed Ropemaker (stands for Remotely Originated Post-delivery Email Manipulation Attacks Keeping Email Risky), the trick was uncovered by Francisco Ribeiro, the researcher at email and cloud security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Mimecast.</span>

A successful exploitation of the Ropemaker attack could allow an attacker to remotely modify the content of an email sent by the attacker itself, for example swapping a URL with the malicious one.

This can be done even after the email has already been delivered to the recipient and made it through all the necessary spam and security filters, without requiring direct access to the recipient‚Äôs computer or email application, exposing hundreds of millions of desktop email client users to malicious attacks.

Ropemaker abuses Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) that are fundamental parts of the way information is presented on the Internet.


"The origin of Ropemaker lies at the intersection of email and Web technologies, more specifically Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) used with HTML," Mimecast's Senior Product Marketing Manager Matthew Gardiner writes in a blog post.


"While the use of these web technologies has made email more visually attractive and dynamic relative to its purely text-based predecessor, this has also introduced an exploitable attack vector for email."

Since CSS is stored remotely, researchers say an attacker can change the content of an email through remotely initiated changes made to the desired 'style' of the email that is then retrieved remotely and presented to the user, without the recipient, even tech savvy users, knowing about it.





According to the researchers, the Ropemaker attack could be leveraged depending upon the creativity of the threat actors.

For instance, attackers could replace a URL that originally directed the user to a legitimate website by a malicious one that sends the user to a compromised site designed to infect users with malware or steal sensitive info, such as their credentials and banking details.

While some systems are designed to detect the URL switch preventing users from opening up the malicious link, other users could be left at a security risk.

Another attack scenario, called "Matrix Exploit" by the Mimecast, is more sophisticated than the "Switch Exploit", and therefore much harder to detect and defend against.

In a Matrix Exploit attack, attackers would write a matrix of text in an email and then use the remote CSS to selectively control what is displayed, allowing the attacker to display whatever they want‚Äîincluding adding malicious URLs into the body of the email.

This attack is harder to defend against because the initial email received by the user does not display any URL, most software systems will not flag the message as malicious.


"Since the URL is rendered post-delivery, an email gateway solution such as Mimecast cannot find, rewrite, or inspect the destination site on-click, because at the time of delivery there would be no URL to detect," the report reads. "To do so would require the interpretation of CSS files, which is beyond the scope of current email security systems."

Although the security firm has not detected the Ropemaker attack in the wild, it believes that this doesn't mean for sure the attack is "not being used somewhere outside the view of Mimecast."

According to the security firm, Ropemaker could be used by hackers to bypass most common security systems and trick even the tech savvy users into interacting with a malicious URL.

To protect themselves from such attacks, users are recommended to rely on web-based email clients like Gmail, iCloud and Outlook, which aren't affected by Ropemaker-style CSS exploits, according to Mimecast.

However, email clients like the desktop and mobile version of Apple Mail, Microsoft Outlook, and Mozilla Thunderbird are all vulnerable to the Ropemaker attack.

Ukraine has once again been a target of a potential hacking attack that infected computer systems from dozens of Ukrainian businesses with highly sophisticated malware, allowing hackers to exfiltrate sensitive data and eavesdrop on their network.

Late last year, the country also suffered a power outage caused by the same group of hackers that targeted Ukraine's power grid with the BlackEnergy malware in late 2015, causing 225,000 residents to lose electricity.

Now security researchers from threat intelligence firm<span class="highlight-match"> CyberX </span>have uncovered an advanced malware-based operation that has already siphoned over 600 gigabytes of data from about 70 victim organizations, including critical infrastructure, news media, and scientific research.

Operation BugDrop: Damages and Modus Operandi
Dubbed "Operation BugDrop," the large-scale malware campaign has been perpetrated against targets in the Ukraine, though targets from other countries include Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Austria.

CyberX researchers did not identify the clandestine hacking collective but said Operation BugDrop was believed to be the work of highly skilled, government-backed nation-state hackers with nearly limitless resources.
"Operation BugDrop is a well-organized operation that employs sophisticated malware and appears to be backed by an organization with substantial resources," reads the CyberX blog post published Wednesday.¬†"In particular, the operation requires a massive back-end infrastructure to store, decrypt, and analyze several GB per day of unstructured data that is being captured from its targets. A large team of human analysts is also required to manually sort through captured data and process it manually and/or with Big Data-like analytics."Here's What the Malware Does:
Operation BugDrop uses sophisticated malware that has been designed to infiltrate the victim's computer and capture screen shots, documents, and passwords, and turn on the PC's microphone to capture audio recordings of all conversations. 

The mysterious hacking group infects victims using malicious Microsoft Word documents sent in phishing emails. Once infected, the compromised PCs send the pilfered audio and data to Dropbox, where the hackers retrieve it.

Since the malware uses PC microphones to bug targets and then send the audio and other data files to Dropbox, the researchers have dubbed the malware campaign Operation BugDrop.

Here's How BugDrop Work:The hackers spread the malware through phishing emails containing Microsoft Office file attachments that include malicious macros embedded in it.

Once the targets open the malware-laden Word document, the hidden, malicious Visual Basic scripts start running in a temporary folder in the background.

The main module of BugDrop downloads the various data-stealing plugins to infected machines and executes them. All the stolen data the malware collects is then uploaded to Dropbox.

Although BugDrop has mainly been designed to record audio files, the malware can also steal the documents, password and other sensitive data from the computer's browsers.

Techniques BugDrop Use to Avoid Detection:
The main malware downloader has low detection rates as:

The malware makes the audio data look like legitimate outgoing traffic.
BugDrop encrypts the DLLs that are installed to avoid detection by traditional anti-virus and sandboxing systems.
The malware uses public cloud service Dropbox.

BugDrop also uses Reflective DLL¬†(Dynamic Link Library)¬†Injection, a malware injection technique that had also been leveraged by the BlackEnergy malware used in the Ukrainian power grid attacks and the Duqu malware in the Stuxnet attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Reflective DLL Injection is used to load malicious code and effectively sidestep security verification procedures without calling the standard Windows API.

Targets of BugDrop:
The malware has targeted a wide range of industries including critical infrastructures, research centers in Ukraine and media organizations.

According to CyberX, BugDrop's primary target has been Ukraine, but it has also been traced to other parts of Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Austria.

Operation BugDrop targets identified by the CyberX researchers so far include:
A firm that designs remote monitoring systems for oil and gas pipeline infrastructures.
An engineering firm that designs electrical substations, water supply plants and gas distribution pipelines.
An international organization that monitors counter-terrorism, human rights, and cyber attacks on critical infrastructure in the Ukraine.
A scientific research institute.
Editors of Ukrainian newspapers.
While concluding the report, CyberX said both private and public sector organizations need to be more vigilant in monitoring their networks and applying more modern technologies like behavioral analytics to identify and quickly respond to these increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks.

Viacom‚Äîthe popular entertainment and media company that owns Paramount Pictures, Comedy Central, MTV, and hundreds of other properties‚Äîhas exposed the keys to its kingdom on an unsecured Amazon S3 server.

A security researcher working for California-based cyber resiliency firm UpGuard has recently discovered a wide-open, public-facing misconfigured Amazon Web Server S3 cloud storage bucket containing roughly a gigabyte's worth of credentials and configuration files for the backend of dozens of Viacom properties.

These exposed credentials discovered by UpGuard researcher Chris Vickery would have been enough for hackers to take down Viacom's internal IT infrastructure and internet presence, allowing them to access cloud servers belonging to MTV, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon.

Among the data exposed in the leak was Viacom's master key to its Amazon Web Services account, and the credentials required to build and maintain Viacom servers across its many subsidiaries and dozens of brands.

"Perhaps most damaging among the exposed data are Viacom's secret cloud keys, an exposure that, in the most damaging circumstances, could put the international media conglomerate's cloud-based servers in the hands of hackers," an UpGuard blog post says.¬†

"Such a scenario could enable malicious actors to launch a host of damaging attacks, using the IT infrastructure of one of the world's largest broadcast and media companies."
In other words, the access key and secret key for the company's AWS account would have allowed hackers to compromise Viacom's servers, storage, and databases under the AWS account.


According to the analysis performed by UpGuard, a number of cloud instances used within the media company's IT toolchain, including Docker,<span class="highlight-match"> Splunk,</span> New Relic, and Jenkins, could have "thus been compromised in this manner."

In addition to these damaging leaks, the unprotected server also contained GPG decryption keys, which can be used to unlock sensitive data. However, the server did not contain any customer or employee information.

Although it is unclear whether hackers were able to exploit this information to access important files belonging to Viacom and the firms it owns, the media giant said there's no evidence anyone had abused its data.

"We have analyzed the data in question and determined there was no material impact," the company said in a statement.

"Once Viacom became aware that information on a server‚Äîincluding technical information, but no employee or customer information‚Äîwas publicly accessible, we rectified the issue."
All the credentials have now been changed after UpGuard contacted Viacom executives privately, and the server was secured shortly afterwards.

This is not the first time when Vickery has discovered a company's sensitive information stored on an unprotected AWS C3 server.

Vickery has previously tracked down many exposed datasets on the Internet, including personal details of over¬†14 million Verizon customers, a cache of 60,000 documents from a US military, information of over 191 Million US voter records, and 13 Million MacKeeper users.

OurMine is in headlines once again‚Äîthis time for breaching the popular video streaming service Vevo.

After hunting down social media accounts of HBO and defacing WikiLeaks website, the infamous self-proclaimed group of white hat hackers OurMine have hacked Vevo and leaked about 3.12 TB worth of internal files.

Vevo is a joint venture between Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, Abu Dhabi Media, Warner Music Group, and Google's parent company Alphabet Inc.

OurMine managed to get hold of Vevo's "sensitive" data including its internal office documents, videos and promotional materials after the hacking collective successfully hacked into the Vevo servers.

The group then posted the stolen documents (approximately 3.12 terabytes) from Vevo on its website on late Thursday, though OurMine removed the stolen information from its website on Vevo's request.



Although it's not clear what prompted OurMine to hack Vevo, the group noted on its website that it initially tried to alert Vevo of the breach privately, but when one of the Vevo's employees responded, "F*** off, you don't have anything," it went public with the data breach and leaked Vevo files.

According to Variety, the stolen files included notes on around 90 artists, including Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Taylor Swift,¬†Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Madonna,¬†Calvin<span class="highlight-match"> Harris,</span> Ariana Grande,¬†Florida Georgia Line, One Direction, Sia, The Weeknd, and U2.

The breach was first reported by Dell Cameron of Gizmodo, who said the leaked Vevo content seems "pretty mild," which contained "weekly music charts, pre-planned social media content, and various details about the artists under the record companies' management."

It‚Äôs not clear for how long the hackers have been accessing the Vevo system, how they managed to gain access to its server, or whether they have held on other additional information, like financial, emails, and passwords.

Vevo has confirmed the security incident, saying the company "can confirm that Vevo experienced a data breach as a result of a phishing scam via Linkedin. We have addressed the issue and are investigating the extent of exposure."

The company also confirmed the breach had not impacted the security of its United Kingdom office.

OurMine is the same group of hackers who are known for hacking high-profile figures and companies, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Game of Thrones, Sony's PlayStation Network (PSN), Netflix, the WWE, HBO, and the most recently WikiLeaks.

OurMine is a Saudi Arabian group of self-proclaimed white hat hackers which markets itself by taking over sites and social media accounts of high-profile targets and then encourages them to contact them to buy their IT security service in an effort to protect themselves from future cyber attacks.

Information on more than 198 Million United States citizens, that's over 60% of the US population, was exposed in what's believed to be the largest ever known exposure of voter-related to date.

This blunder was caused by Deep Root Analytics (DRA), a data analytics firm employed by the US Republican National Committee (RNC), who "mistakenly" left sensitive personal details of more than 198 million US voters exposed on an unsecured Amazon S3 server.

Chris Vickery, a security researcher at UpGuard, who discovered the exposed database said anyone could have downloaded more than a Terabytes of files containing voters data without the need for any password from the Amazon S3 server maintained by DRA.

Vickery is the same security researcher who discovered over 191 million voter records stored in an unsecured database in late 2015.¬†In April, Vickey also reported information on 93 million Mexican voters.


Vickery discovered the exposed databases on June 12, which included uniquely identified data on each voter, including their first and last name, date of birth, phone number, home and mailing address, party affiliation, voter registration data, and ethnicity, along with a flag should the person appear on the federal Do-Not-Call registry.

Deep Root Analytics, which is a big data analytics firm that helps advertisers identify audiences for political ads, confirmed to the Gizmodo in a statement on Monday, saying "We take full responsibility for this situation."

However, the server was secured two days later after Vickery responsibly reported the blunder to the federal regulators.

You would be surprised to know that the Republican National Committee paid Deep Root nearly a Million dollars between January 2015 and November 2016 for their work during the election and another $4.2 Million to TargetPoint.

It is believed that the US voters data was also compiled by at least two other contractors, TargetPoint Consulting Inc. and Data Trust.

According to the report, a  smaller folder for the 2016 election included in the database contained files for Ohio and Florida, arguably the two most crucial battleground states.

Another folder named 'data_trust' appears to reference Data Trust, was entirely downloadable by any individual accessing the URL of the database and contained two massive stores of personal information collectively representing 198 million potential voters.

"Consisting primarily of two file repositories, a 256 GB folder for the 2008 presidential election and a 233 GB folder for 2012, each containing fifty-one files - one for every state, as well as the District of Columbia," explained UpGuard's Dan O'Sullivan in a blog post.

Also, one folder called "Post-Elect 2016" contained information on voters‚Äô likely views about topics like whether they voted for former President Barack Obama and US President Donald Trump‚Äôs "America First" foreign policy.

Deep Root has contracted a security firm,<span class="highlight-match"> Stroz Friedberg,</span> to perform a thorough investigation of the data exposure.

The insider threat is the worst nightmare for a company, as the employees can access company's most sensitive data without having to circumvent security measures designed to keep out external threats.

The rogue employee can collect, leak, or sell all your secrets, including professional, confidential, and upcoming project details, to your rival companies and much more that could result in significant loss to your company.

And this is exactly what is happening on Dark Web Marketplace -- a place where one can sell and purchase everything from illicit drugs to exploits, malware, and stolen data.

According to a new report from the US-based risk security firm<span class="highlight-match"> RedOwl </span>and Israeli threat intelligence firm IntSights, staff at corporations are selling company's internal secrets for cash to hackers on one of the most famous dark web markets Kick Ass Marketplace (Onion URL).

Besides selling their company's secret information, researchers also found evidence of rogue staff, in some cases, even working with hackers to infect their company networks with malware.

Kick Ass Marketplace offers a subscription of up to one bitcoin (currently around $950) a month to its clients for giving them access to a variety of "vetted and accurate" insider information that is posted onto the website.

Every post is assigned a "confidence rating," along with advice on whether to buy and sell stock in the associated company, allowing its clients to cash in on the insider secrets they collected.

In May last year, an administrator of the Kick Ass Marketplace site going by the pseudonym "h3x" was interviewed by DeepDotWeb, claiming that his site had 15 investment firm members, 25 subscribers, 3 hackers and 2 trading analysts who observe financial markets and verify the integrity of stolen data before posting it to the website.

According to the new report "Monetizing the Insider: The Growing Symbiosis of Insiders and the Dark Web" [PDF] published Wednesday, Kick Ass Marketplace posts about five high confidence insider trading reports every week and makes some US $35,800 a week.

Researchers at RedOwl and IntSights also analyzed another dark web marketplace called "The Stock¬†Insiders" (Onion URL) that only focuses on insider trading opportunities, like recruiting cashiers or other low-end retail staff to cash out stolen credit cards for resellable goods like Apple iPhones.

"In one instance, a hacker solicited bank insiders to plant malware directly onto the bank‚Äôs network," says the researchers Ido Wulkan (IntSights), Tim Condello (RedOwl), David Pogemiller (RedOwl).¬†

"This approach significantly reduces the cost of action as the hacker doesn‚Äôt have to conduct phishing exercises and can raise success rates by bypassing many of the organization‚Äôs technical defenses (e.g. anti-virus or sandboxing)."
The trio even discovered that one hacker was ready to pay the insider "7 figures on a weekly basis" for helping him gaining access to a bank's computer.



The activity of company's insider threats on dark websites has doubled in the last year, which poses a real threat to both consumers and investors, causing greater financial losses than attacks that originate outside the company.

RedOwl and IntSights suggest that corporations should take the insider threat more seriously by making use of IT security systems to carefully monitor their employees without violating their privacy.

On Thursday, we compiled a story based on research published by a British security expert reporting that some cyber criminals are apparently using Mirai Botnet to conduct DDoS attacks against the telecommunication companies in Liberia, a small African country.

In his blog post, Kevin Beaumont claimed that a Liberian transit provider confirmed him about the DDoS attack of more than 500 Gbps targeting one undersea cable servicing Internet connectivity for the entire country.

Later, some media outlets also confirmed that the DDoS attack caused Internet outage in some parts of the country, citing ‚Äòslow Internet‚Äô and ‚Äòtotal outage‚Äô experienced by some local sources and citizens.

"The DDoS is killing our business. We have a challenge with the DDoS. We are hoping someone can stop it. It's killing our revenue. Our business has frequently been targeted" an employee with one Liberian mobile service provider told PC World.
Network firm<span class="highlight-match"> Level 3 </span>confirmed Zack Whittaker of ZDNet that it had seen attacks on telecoms companies in Liberia making access to the web spotty. Other reports suggested mobile net access was affected too.

"At first I thought it was a problem with my internet provider, which often suffers from slow speeds. But this feels more serious. Even when you do get online, the connection repeatedly cuts out." BBC Africa's Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Liberia shared his experience.
Of course, based on the high concern, the story went viral and Kevin's research was covered by other media outlets, including BBC, PC World, The Guardian, Forbes, IBtimes, Quartz, Mashable, although few of them interpreted the incident incorrectly and claimed that the attack took down the entire country's Internet.

In our article, we explicitly mentioned multiple times that criminals are "using Mirai Botnet to shut down the Internet for an entire country" and "trying to take down the Internet of Liberia."

The only mistake in our previous article was the image caption which briefly said, "DDoS takes down entire country offline." We apologize to our readers for an incorrect image caption, which has now been corrected.


Latest Insights On Liberia DDoS Attack Story

After Kevin‚Äôs story, some new developments with more insights have appeared.

Doug Madory, the Director of Internet Analysis at Dyn Research¬†tweeted that DYN and Internet-infrastructure company Akamai have no data that supports any nationwide Internet outage in Liberia.

The Hacker News has also been contacted by Kpetermeni Siakor, who manages infrastructure at the Liberia Internet Exchange Point, stating that only Lonestarcell MTN, one of the country's four major telecommunication companies, faced 500 Gbps of DDoS attack for a short period, which was mitigated successfully.

"From inspecting our logs at the Liberia IXP, we didn't see any downtime in the past three weeks. The general manager of the CCL also couldn't confirm any issues with the ACE cable," Siakor said.
In our previous article, the primary concern surrounds around two facts: The Mirai Botnet capability and ACE submarine fiber-optic cable capacity.

Where just 100,000 Mirai bots were successful in knocking down the majority of Internet Offline two weeks ago, how easy it could be for millions of bots to DDoS the ACE submarine fiber-optic cable, whose total capacity is just 5.12 Tbps that is being shared between all of the 23 countries, including Liberia.

So, when we said that someone was trying to take the entire country down, we meant that cyber criminals have such capacity to do so, and since they have targeted one network operator, does not mean they would not attack other network operators that could impact the Internet services in the country.


Mirai Malware Threat: Protect Your IoT Devices

The incidents involving the Mirai malware is extremely worrying because it can take over insecure cameras, DVRs, and routers, which are widely available all around the world ‚Äì Thanks to lazy manufacturers and customers.

Mirai malware scans for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are still using their default passwords and then enslaves those devices into a botnet, which is then used to launch DDoS attacks.

So, the best way to protect yourself and your devices is to be more vigilant about the security of your smart devices.

In our previous article, we provided some basic, rather practical, solutions that will help you protect your IoT devices from becoming part of the Mirai botnet. You can also check also yourself if your IoT device is vulnerable to Mirai malware.

The biggest advertising fraud ever!

A group of hackers is making between $3 Million to $5 Million per day from United States brands and media companies in the biggest digital ad fraud ever discovered.

Online fraud-prevention firm<span class="highlight-match"> White Ops </span>uncovered this new Ad fraud campaign, dubbed "Methbot," that automatically generates more than 300 Million fraudulent video ad impressions every day.

The cyber criminal gang, dubbed AFT13, has developed Methbot robo-browser that spoofs all the necessary interactions needed to initiate, carry out and complete the ad transactions.

The hackers, allegedly based in Russia, registered more than 6,000 domains and 250,267 distinct URLs impersonating brand and names of high-profile websites like ESPN, Vogue, CBS Sports, Fox News and the Huffington Post, and selling fake video ad slots.

Cyber criminals behind Methbot are using servers hosted in Texas and Amsterdam to power more than 570,000 bots with forged IP addresses, mostly belongs to the United States, which make it appear ads are being viewed by US visitors.




The cyber criminals then obtain video-ad inventory to display to its fake media websites for top dollar and fools the ad marketplace into thinking the ad content is being watched by legitimate website visitors.

But in reality, these video ads are viewed by Methbot's fake viewers, as the fraud also includes an automated software program that mimics a user watching ads.

To make their bots look more real, the gang is using methods like automated faked clicks, social network login information, and mouse movements.

The security firm found that the fraudsters‚Äô bot army watched as many as 300 Million ads per day, with an average payout of $13.04 per 1000 faked views.

If you multiply this number by more than 570,000 compromised IP addresses, the money rolls in.

The company believes that Methbot creates an estimated between 200 Million and 300 Million fraudulent video ad impressions per day, targets roughly 6,000 publishers and generates between $3 Million and $5 Million in revenue every 24 hours.

White Ops initially noticed the activity of Methbot last year in September, but in October 2016, the campaign dramatically risen.

The Methbot operation is headquartered in Russia but uses data centers in Dallas and Amsterdam. Although this information is not enough to prove that the hackers are of Russian origin, White Ops evidently believes that the hacker group is based in Russia.

White Ops has notified the FBI about the scam and has been working with federal law enforcement for weeks now.

Do you own an Amazon Echo?

So are you also worried about hackers turning out your device into a covert listening device?

Just relax, if there's no NSA, no CIA or none of your above-skilled friends after you.

Since yesterday there have been several reports on Amazon Echo hack that could allow a hacker to turn your smart speaker into a covert listening device, but users don‚Äôt need to worry because the hack is not simple, requires physical access to the device and does not work on all devices, as well.

Amazon Echo is an always-listening voice-activated smart home speaker that is designed to play music, set alarms, answer questions via the Alexa voice assistant, and control connected smart home devices like WeMo, Hive and Nest.


Hack Turns Amazon Echo Into Spying Device (But It's Complex)

Now researchers from<span class="highlight-match"> MWR </span>InfoSecurity have demonstrated a hack, showing how hackers can exploit a vulnerability in some models of Amazon Echo to turn them into covert listening devices that can secretly record your most intimate moments.

But the hack is not simple and has some significant limitations:



The first major limitation of the Amazon Echo hack is that it does involve the hacker being able to gain physical access to the device, though, according to researchers, it is possible to tamper with the Echo without leaving any traces behind.
The second limitation is that the Amazon Echo hack works only against older models, as the vulnerability discovered by MWR researchers only affects the 2015 and 2016 versions of the AI-powered speaker.
Another major limitation to carry out this hack is that the attacker should be above average skills in Linux as well as embedded hardware systems.


In short, it is a very sophisticated hack that first requires James Bond to bypass all CCTV cameras, if you have, to stealthily gain physical access to your premises, and then at least 30 minutes spare time with the Amazon Echo to install the malware without leaving any traces of tampering.

In another scenario, as described by the researchers, your house cleaner or maid who has access to your device could also perform this attack, so the researchers dubbed the attack as "evil maid."

However, the 'evil maid' attack is not as impressive as it sounds because in such highly targeted scenario one can simply implant bugging devices with less effort, knowledge and time.


Hacking Amazon Echo: How It Works?


In order to carry out the evil maid hack, MWR Labs security researcher Mark Barnes first removed the Echo's rubber base on the bottom, which allowed them to access 18 debug "pads" Amazon engineers rely on to carry out various diagnostics.

Barnes then directly booted into the actual firmware of the device via an external SD card. From there, he was able to install persistent malware without leaving any physical traces of tampering with the device.

The malware then allowed the researcher to gain remote root shell access of the device, and ultimately access to the 'always listening' microphones.

"Once we'd root we examined the processes running on the device and the scripts that spawn these processes," Barnes wrote. "We were able to understand how audio media is being passed and buffered between processes and the tools that are used to create and interact with these audio buffers."
Barnes said his team then developed scripts that leveraged tools embedded on the Amazon Echo to continuously stream the raw microphone audio over TCP/IP to a remote server without affecting the actual functionality of the device itself.

This eventually means that hackers, at least theoretically, can covertly monitor and listen in on users conversations and steal private data without their permission or even realisation.

"The rooting of the Amazon Echo device in itself was trivial; however, it raises a number of important questions for manufacturers of Internet enabled or 'Smart Home' devices," Barnes added.
The researcher warned users from buying smart speakers from third-party retailers, along with advising them to push the Echo's mute button to disable the microphone physically.

In response to the MWR's findings, Amazon released a statement saying the best way for users to protect themselves from such tamperings is always to buy the Echo from the company directly.

"Customer trust is very important to us. To help ensure the latest safeguards are in place, as a general rule, we recommend customers purchase Amazon devices from Amazon or a trusted retailer and that they keep their software up-to-date," the company said.
Users owning 2017 models of the device are not affected by this latest hack, as the new models introduced a mitigation that joins two of the crucial debugging pads in a way that prevents the device from external booting.

Security researchers have discovered a critical remotely exploitable vulnerability in an open-source software development library used by major manufacturers of the Internet-of-Thing devices that eventually left millions of devices vulnerable to hacking.

The vulnerability (CVE-2017-9765), discovered by researchers at the IoT-focused security firm Senrio, resides in the software development library called gSOAP toolkit (Simple Object Access Protocol) ‚Äî an advanced C/C++ auto-coding tool for developing XML Web services and XML application.

Dubbed "Devil's Ivy," the stack buffer overflow vulnerability allows a remote attacker to crash the SOAP WebServices daemon and could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable devices.


The Devil's Ivy vulnerability was discovered by researchers while analysing an Internet-connected security camera manufactured by Axis Communications.

"When exploited, it allows an attacker to remotely access a video feed or deny the owner access to the feed," researchers say.¬†

"Since these cameras are meant to secure something, like a bank lobby, this could lead to collection of sensitive information or prevent a crime from being observed or recorded."

Axis confirmed the vulnerability that exists in almost all of its 250 camera models (you can find the complete list of affected camera models here) and has quickly released patched firmware updates on July 6th to address the vulnerability, prompting partners and customers to upgrade as soon as possible.

However, researchers believe that their exploit would work on internet-connected devices from other vendors as well, as the affected software is used by Canon,<span class="highlight-match"> Siemens,</span> Cisco, Hitachi, and many others.

Axis immediately informed Genivia, the company that maintains gSOAP, about the vulnerability and Genivia released a patch on June 21, 2017.

The company also reached out to electronics industry consortium ONVIF to ensure all of its members, including Canon, Cisco, and Siemens, those who make use of¬†gSOAP¬†become aware of the issue and can develop patches to fix the security hole.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices has always been the weakest link and, therefore, an easy entry for hackers to get into secured networks. So it is always advisable to keep your Internet-connected devices updated and away from the public Internet.

Besides a previously undisclosed code-execution flaw in Microsoft Word, the tech giant patches two more zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers had been exploiting in the wild for months, as part of this month's Patch Tuesday.

In total, Microsoft patches 45 unique vulnerabilities in its nine products, including three previously undisclosed vulnerabilities under active attack.

The first vulnerability (CVE-2017-0199) under attack is a remote-code execution flaw that could allow an attacker to remotely take over a fully patched and up to date computer when the victim opens a Word document containing a booby-trapped OLE2link object.

The attack can bypass most exploit mitigations developed by Microsoft, and according to Ryan Hanson of security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Optiv,</span> in some cases, exploits can execute malicious code even when Protected View is enabled.

As The Hacker News reported Monday, this code-execution flaw in Microsoft Word was being exploited by hackers to spread a version of infamous Dridex banking trojan. 

Also, according to blog posts published Tuesday by security firms FireEye and Netskope, hackers are exploiting the same Word vulnerability to install Latentbot and Godzilla malware respectively.

Microsoft has released a fix for CVE-2017-0199 and credited Hanson with responsible reporting the critical vulnerability to the company.


Patch for Critical IE Flaw Being Exploited in the Wild

The company also pushed out a patch for another critical vulnerability (CVE-2017-0210) under active attack. The flaw is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Internet Explorer that would allow an attacker to trick a victim into visiting a compromised website.

The vulnerability could allow the attacker to access sensitive information from one domain and inject it into another domain.

"The vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, the vulnerability could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (for example, a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code," Microsoft's guidance for the flaw reads.
This IE vulnerability is also being exploited in the wild.


Another Critical Word Vulnerability Yet Unpatched!

The third previously undisclosed flaw (CVE-2017-2605) resides in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) filter in Microsoft Office, but Microsoft did not actually release an update for this flaw in Tuesday's update batch.

However, the tech giant issued an update for Microsoft Office that, by default, disable the EPS filter in MS Office as a defense measure. This Word vulnerability is also being exploited in the wild when a target opens a malicious EPS image in Word.

"Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks that could leverage an unpatched vulnerability in the EPS filter and is taking this action to help reduce customer risk until the security update is released," the guidance for the flaw reads.
The company also issued a patch for Windows 10 Creators Update, which was made available on Tuesday, addressing some remote code execution flaws and elevation of privilege bugs.

In total, Microsoft rolled out 15 security updates on Tuesday patching dozens of unique CVEs in its products, including the Windows OS, Exchange Server, Edge and Internet Explorer, Office, Office Services and Office Web Apps, Visual Studio for Mac Silverlight and Adobe Flash.

Users are strongly advised to install updates as soon as possible in order to protect themselves against the active attacks in the wild on three separate Microsoft products.

Researchers have uncovered a Chinese cyber-espionage against the United States ahead of the trade summit on Thursday between US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping.

According to a new report published today by<span class="highlight-match"> Fidelis Cybersecurity </span>firm, the Chinese APT10 hacking group implanted a piece of malware on the "Events" page of the US National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC) website in February.

Dubbed 'Operation TradeSecret,' the attack against the NFTC site is seen as an attempt to conduct surveillance on the main industry players and lobbyists closely associated with U.S trade policy activities. 

Researchers say hackers placed a malicious link on the NFTC website, inviting the organization's board of directors to register for a meeting in Washington DC on March 7. But clicking on the link deployed a spying tool called "Scanbox."

Dates back to 2014, Scanbox ‚Äì previously used by nation-state threat actors associated with the Chinese government ‚Äì has the ability to record the type and versions of software a victim is running and run keyloggers on compromised computers, said Fidelis researcher John Bambenek.

"This attack was really at its core a reconnaissance attack. Anyone who visited this calendar entry would expose their software versions and use a JavaScript keylogger that could expose their identity," said Bambenek.

"Traditionally these attacks are used to precisely identify targets and help them craft targeted phishing attacks using exploits they know the victim is vulnerable to."
The malicious link was active on the NFTC website between February 27 and March 1. The malware was already removed from the site by the time Fidelis contacted NFTC.

The NFTC's staff and board represent many influential people and companies -- from President Rufus Yerxa, the U.S. Ambassador to GATT to executives from major companies including Google, Amazon, eBay, IBM, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, KPMG, Pfizer, Visa, Ford, Halliburton, and Walmart.

Although Fidelis detected no further attacks on NFTC board members, the security firm believed the hackers were after a full range of entities relevant to the trade negotiations due to take place Thursday between US and China.

This is the second time in a week when APT10 cyber espionage campaign has come to light. A report released this week by BAE Systems, and PwC also claimed that APT10 was targeting managed IT services providers (MSPs) and their customers across the globe to steal sensitive data.

A severe security vulnerability has been discovered in the CloudFlare content delivery network that has caused big-name websites to expose private session keys and other sensitive data.

CloudFlare, a content delivery network (CDN) and web security provider that helps optimize safety and performance of over 5.5 Million websites on the Internet, is warning its customers of the critical bug that could have exposed a range of sensitive information, including passwords, and cookies and tokens used to authenticate users.

Dubbed Cloudbleed, the nasty flaw is named after the Heartbleed bug that was discovered in 2014, but believed to be worse than Heartbleed.

The vulnerability is so severe that it not only affects websites on the CloudFlare network but affects mobile apps as well.

What exactly is "Cloudbleed," how it works, how are you affected by this bug, and how you can protect yourself? Let's figure it out.


What is Cloudbleed?

Discovered by Google Project Zero security researcher Tavis Ormandy over a week ago, Cloudbleed is a major flaw in the Cloudflare Internet infrastructure service that causes the leakage of private session keys and other sensitive information across websites hosted behind Cloudflare.

CloudFlare acts as a proxy between the user and web server, which caches content for websites that sits behind its global network and lowers the number of requests to the original host server by parsing content through Cloudflare‚Äôs edge servers for optimization and security.

Almost a week ago, Ormandy discovered a buffer overflow issue with Cloudflare's edge servers that were running past the end of a buffer and were returning memory containing private data like HTTP cookies, authentication tokens, and HTTP POST bodies, with some of the leaked data already cached by search engines.


Here's How Serious is Cloudbleed:





"I'm finding private messages from major dating sites, full messages from a well-known chat service, online password manager data, frames from adult video sites, hotel bookings," Ormandy wrote in a blog post that was also published Thursday. "We're talking full HTTPS requests, client IP addresses, full responses, cookies, passwords, keys, data, everything."
According to Ormandy, Cloudflare had code in its "ScrapeShield" feature that did something similar to this:

int Length = ObfuscateEmailAddressesInHtml(&OutputBuffer, CachedPage);
write(fd, OutputBuffer, Length);
But the company was not checking if the obfuscation parsers returned a negative value because of malicious HTML.

The Cloudflare's "ScrapeShield" feature parses and obfuscates HTML, but since reverse proxies are shared among customers, it would affect all CloudFlare customers.

Ormandy contacted Cloudflare and reported it about his findings. The company identified the cause of the issue, and immediately disabled 3 minor Cloudflare features ‚Äî Email obfuscation, Server-side Excludes, as well as Automatic HTTPS Rewrites ‚Äî that were using the same HTML parser chain, which was causing the leakage.

Ormandy observed encryption keys, passwords, cookies, chunks of POST data, and HTTPS requests for the other leading Cloudflare-hosted websites from other users and immediately contacted Cloudflare.

Since CloudFlare patched the issue but did not notify customers by Wednesday of the data leak issue, Ormandy made public his findings on Thursday, following Project Zero's seven-day policy for actively exploited attacks.

Following Ormandy's public disclosure of the vulnerability on Thursday, CloudFlare confirmed the flaw, ensuring its customers that their SSL private keys were not leaked.

"Cloudflare has always terminated SSL connections through an isolated instance of NGINX that was not affected by this bug," Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cumming wrote in a blog post. "The bug was serious because the leaked memory could contain private information and because it had been cached by search engines."

"We are disclosing this problem now as we are satisfied that search engine caches have now been cleared of sensitive information," he added. "We have also not discovered any evidence of malicious exploits of the bug or other reports of its existence."


The Root Cause of Cloudbleed:

The root cause of the Cloudbleed vulnerability was that¬†"reaching the end of a buffer was checked using the equality operator and a pointer was able to step past the end of the buffer."¬†

 "Had the check been done using >= instead of == jumping over the buffer end would have been caught,"¬†said Cumming.

Cloudflare has also confirmed that the greatest period of impact was between February 13 and February 18 with almost one in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests via Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage, which is about 0.00003% of requests.

However, the researcher argued that the DNS provider was double-dealing, claiming that the Cloudbleed vulnerability had existed for months, based on Google's cached data.


How Does Cloudbleed Affect You?

There are a large number of Cloudflare's services and websites that use parsing HTML pages and modify them through the Cloudflare's edge servers.

Even if you do not use CloudFlare directly, that does not mean that you are spared. There is always a chance that websites you visit and web services you use may have been affected, leaking your data as well.

Of course, if you are using Cloudflare services in front of your site, the flaw could impact you, exposing sensitive information that flowed between your servers and end-users through CloudFlare's proxies.

While CloudFlare's service was rapidly patched the bug and has said the actual impact is relatively minor, data was leaking constantly before this ‚Äî for months.

Some of this leaked data were publicly cached in search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, who now removed it, but some engines like DuckDuckGo still host those data.

Also, other leaked data might exist in other services and caches throughout the Web, which is impossible to delete across all of these locations.


Cloudbleed Also Affects Mobile Apps

Cloudbleed also affects mobile apps, because, in many cases, the apps are designed to make use of the same backends as browsers for content delivery and HTTPS (SSL/TLS) termination.

Users on YCombinator have confirmed the presence of HTTP header data for apps like Discord, FitBit, and Uber by searching through DuckDuckGo caches with targeted search terms.

In an analysis conducted by<span class="highlight-match"> NowSecure,</span> the researchers have discovered some 200 iOS apps that identified as using Cloudflare services from a sampling of some 3,500 of the most popular apps on the app store.

There is always a possibility of someone discovering this vulnerability before Tavis, and may have been actively exploiting it, although there is no evidence to support this theory.

Some of the Cloudflare's major customers affected by the vulnerability included Uber, 1Password, FitBit, and OKCupid. However, in a blog post published by 1Password, the company assured its users that no sensitive data was exposed because the service was encrypted in transit.

However, a list of websites that have potentially been impacted by this bug has been published by a user, who go by the name of 'pirate,' on¬†GitHub, which also included CoinBase, 4Chan, BitPay, DigitalOcean, Medium, ProductHunt, Transferwise, The Pirate Bay, Extra Torrent, BitDefender, Pastebin, Zoho, Feedly, Ashley Madison, Bleeping Computer, The Register, and many more.

Since CloudFlare does not yet provide the list of affected services, bear in mind that this is not a comprehensive list.


What should You do about the Cloudbleed bug?

Online users are strongly recommended to reset their passwords for all accounts in case you have reused the same passwords on every site, as well as monitor account activity closely as cleanup is underway.

Moreover, customers who are using Cloudflare for their websites are advised to force a password change for all of their users.

Update: Uber representative reached out to me via an email and said their investigation revealed that the CloudBleed bug exposed no passwords of their customers. Here's the statement provided by Uber:

"Very little Uber traffic actually goes through Cloudflare, so only a handful of tokens were involved and have since been changed. Passwords were not exposed."

Meanwhile, DuckDuckGo spokesperson also reached out to The Hacker News and said the search engine has removed the leaked data from DuckDuckGo.

An anti-malware detection service provider and premium security firm has been accused of leaking terabytes of confidential data from several Fortune 1000 companies, including customer credentials, financial records, network intelligence and other sensitive data.

However, in response to the accusations, the security firm confirmed that they are not pulling sensitive files from its customers; instead, it's up to companies‚Äîwho are accidentally (but explicitly) sharing their sensitive data to leverage an optional cloud-based anti-malware service.

On Wednesday, Information security firm DirectDefense published a blog post, claiming that they found a major issue with endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution offered by US-based company<span class="highlight-match"> Carbon Black,</span> alleging that the company is leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive files from its customers.

Carbon Black is a leading incident response and threat hunting company that offers security products to nearly thirty of the largest 100 public and privately held companies in the US, including Silicon Valley leaders in internet search, social media, government, and finance.


DirectDefense Claims 'Carbon Black' Leaking Data

According to DirectDefense, the company's CB Response is responsible for leaking a massive amount of its customers' data‚Äîfrom cloud keys and app store keys to credentials and other sensitive trade secrets‚Äîdue to its dependence on third-party multi-scanner services.

Carbon Black specialises in next-generation antivirus plus endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions in one cloud-delivered platform that stops malware and other cyber attacks.

The product works by identifying "good" and "bad" files and then creating their whitelist to prevent its clients from running harmful files on their systems. So, the tool continuously evaluates an enormous and ever-expanding pool of files for a potential infection.

DirectDefence claims whenever the tool encounters a new file on its clients' computer that it has never seen before, it first uploads the file to Carbon Black servers, and then company forwards a copy of that file to VirusTotal multiscanner service (owned by Google) that contains dozens of antivirus engines to check if the file is good or bad.

But according to DirectDefense President Jim Broome:

"Cloud-based multi-scanner service [VirusTotal] operate as for-profit businesses. They survive by charging for access to advanced tools sold to malware analysts, governments, corporate security teams, security companies, and basically whomever is willing to pay."
So, anyone who is willing to pay would get access to the multiscanner and eventually access to the files submitted to its database.

Broome called the scheme as "the world's largest pay-for-play data exfiltration botnet."

Broome says he discovered this issue in mid-2016 when his company was working on a potential breach on its client‚Äôs computer.

While using the VirusTotal cloud-based multi-scanner to search for a possible piece of malware which it suspected of infecting its client, his staff came across a batch of internal applications belonging to a "very large telecommunications equipment vendor."

After digging deeper, the team discovered that the files were uploaded by Carbon Black, as identified by its unique API key (32d05c66). Once the team had that primary key, it was able to locate "hundreds of thousands of files comprising terabytes of data."

"We downloaded about 100 files (we found JAR files and script files to be the easiest to analyse by script), and ran these files through some simple pattern matching," Broome writes.

"When we got hits, we‚Äôd try to extrapolate where they came from. We were not trying to be exhaustive in the analysis, and only repeated this operation a few times to see if it still held true."

DirectDefense Found Sensitive Data Leaked From Top Companies
Broome says he identified three companies to whom the files his team downloaded belonged, though he doesn't disclose the names of the affected companies.

Here is some information DirectDefense revealed about the three affected companies:

Large Streaming Media Company
The first company was a large streaming media firm, and files associated with this company contained, among other sensitive files:

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) Credentials
Slack API Keys
The Company‚Äôs Crowd (Atlassian Single Sign On)
Admin Credentials
Google Play keys
Apple Store ID


Social Media Company
The second company was a social media company, and files associated with this firm included:

Hardcoded AWS and Azure keys
Other internal proprietary information, like usernames and passwords


Financial Services Company

The third firm is a financial services provider, for which researchers discovered:

Shared AWS keys that granted access to customer financial data
Trade secrets that included financial models and possibly direct consumer data


"Our intention with releasing this information was not to attack customers or security vendors," Broome writes, and we don‚Äôt pretend that we‚Äôve performed an exhaustive analysis of the breadth of the leaks. We only know that every time we looked, we found this same serious breach of confidentiality."


Carbon Black Explains the Origin of Data Leak


However, in response to DirectDefence allegations, Carbon Black Co-founder and CTO Michael Viscuso published a blog post today explaining that their CB Response tool doesn't upload all files automatically to VirusTotal; instead, the feature comes disabled by default, leaving the choice to users to use its multiscanner service.

"Cb Response has a feature that allows customers to send their unknown or suspicious binaries to these cloud-based multi-scanners (specifically VirusTotal) automatically," Viscuso writes.

"We allow customers to opt into these services and inform them of the privacy risks associated with sharing."

"If the customer enables the second option (complete binaries with VirusTotal) Cb Response ensures that the customer understands the risks associated with uploading full binaries to a public multi-scanner service with an explicit warning"¬†
This means, at first place, top-notch companies¬†are accidentally (but explicitly) leaking their sensitive files on VirusTotal database.

Broome also suspects that this issue is not unique to Carbon Black, other EDR providers may also be leaking its customers' data in the same way.

As part of its "October Patch Tuesday," Microsoft has today released a large batch of security updates to patch a total of 62 vulnerabilities in its products, including a severe MS office zero-day flaw that has been exploited in the wild.

Security updates also include patches for Microsoft Windows operating systems, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Skype, Microsoft Lync and Microsoft SharePoint Server.

Besides the MS Office vulnerability, the company has also addressed two other publicly disclosed (but not yet targeted in the wild) vulnerabilities that affect the SharePoint Server and the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

October patch Tuesday also fixes a critical Windows DNS vulnerability that could be exploited by a malicious DNS server to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system. Below you can find a brief technical explanation of all above mentioned critical and important vulnerabilities.

Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11826)

This vulnerability, classified by Microsoft as "important," is caused by a memory corruption issue. It affects all supported versions of MS Office and has been actively exploited by the attackers in targeted attacks.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability either by sending a specially crafted Microsoft Office file to the victims and convincing them to open it, or hosting a site containing specially crafted files and tricking victims to visit it.

Once opened, the malicious code within the booby-trapped Office file will execute with the same rights as the logged-in user. So, users with least privilege on their systems are less impacted than those having higher admin rights.

The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft by security researchers at China-based security firm Qihoo 360<span class="highlight-match"> Core Security,</span> who initially detected an in-the-wild cyber attack which involved malicious RTF files and leveraged this vulnerability on September 28.


Microsoft Windows DNSAPI Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11779)

Among other critical vulnerabilities patched by Microsoft include a critical remote code execution flaw in the Windows DNS client that affects computers running Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, and Windows Server 2012 through 2016.

The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious DNS response, allowing an attacker gain arbitrary code execution on Windows clients or Windows Server installations in the context of the software application that made the DNS request.

Nick Freeman, a security researcher from security firm Bishop Fox, discovered the vulnerability and demonstrated how an attacker connected to a public Wi-Fi network could run malicious code on a victim's machine, escalate privileges and take full control over the target computer or server.

"This means that if an attacker controls your DNS server (e.g., through a Man-in-the-Middle attack or a malicious coffee-shop hotspot) ‚Äì they can gain access to your system," the researcher explains.

"This doesn‚Äôt only affect web browsers ‚Äì your computer makes DNS queries in the background all the time, and any query can be responded to in order to trigger this issue."


For full technical details, you can watch the video demonstration by Bishop Fox‚Äôs Dan Petro and head on to Bishop Fox‚Äôs blog post.

Windows Subsystem for Linux Denial of Service Vulnerability (CVE-2017-8703)

This denial of service (DoS) issue is yet another noteworthy vulnerability which resides in Windows Subsystem for Linux.

The vulnerability, classified by Microsoft as "important," was previously publicly disclosed, but wasn't found actively exploited in the wild.

The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute a malicious application to affect an object in the memory, which eventually allows that the application to crash the target system and made it unresponsive.

The only affected Microsoft product by this vulnerability is Windows 10 (Version 1703). "The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Subsystem for Linux handles objects in memory," Microsoft said in its advisory.


Microsoft Office SharePoint XSS Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11777)

Another previously disclosed but not yet under attack vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in Microsoft SharePoint Server that affects SharePoint Enterprise Server 2013 Service Pack 1 and SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016.

The vulnerability, also classified by Microsoft as "important," can be exploited by sending a maliciously crafted request to an affected SharePoint server.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems and execute malicious script in the same security context of the current user.

"The attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the attacker is not authorised to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the user," Microsoft explains.
Besides these, the company has patched a total of 19 vulnerabilities in the scripting engine in Edge and Internet Explorer that could allow web pages to achieve remote-code execution, with the logged-in user's permissions, via memory corruption flaws.

Just opening a web page could potentially land you in trouble by executing malware, spyware, ransomware, and other nasty software on the vulnerable computer.


More RCE And Other Vulnerabilities

Redmond also patched two vulnerabilities in the Windows font library that can allow a web page or document to execute malicious code on a vulnerable machine and hijack it on opening a file with a specially crafted embedded font or visiting a website hosting the malicious file.

The update also includes fixes for a bug in Windows TRIE (CVE-2017-11769) that allows DLL files to achieve remote code execution, a programming error (CVE-2017-11776) in Outlook that leaves its emails open to snooping over supposedly secure connections.

Other issues patched this month include two remote code execution flaws in the Windows Shell and a remote code execution bug in Windows Search.

Microsoft also published an advisory warning user of a security feature bypass issue affecting the firmware of Infineon Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs).

Surprisingly, Adobe Flash does not include any security patches. Meanwhile, Adobe has skipped October's Patch Tuesday altogether.

Users are strongly advised to apply October security patches as soon as possible in order to keep hackers and cybercriminals away from taking control over their computers.

For installing security updates, simply head on to Settings ‚Üí Update & security ‚Üí Windows Update ‚Üí Check for updates, or you can install the updates manually.

Vulnerabilities discovered in Microsoft PatchGuard kernel protection could allow hackers to plant rootkits on computers running the company's latest and secure operating system, Windows 10.

Researchers at<span class="highlight-match"> CyberArk </span>Labs have developed a new attack technique which could allow hackers to completely bypass PatchGuard, and hook a malicious kernel code (rootkits) at the kernel level.

PatchGuard, or (or Kernel Patch Protection) is a software tool that has been designed to forbid the kernel of 64-bit versions of Windows OS from being patched, preventing hackers from running rootkits or executing malicious code at the kernel level.

Dubbed GhostHook, the attack is what the CyberArk Labs researchers call the first attack technique that thwarts the defensive technology to bypass PatchGuard, though it requires a hacker to already be present on a compromised system and running code in the kernel.

So, basically, this is a post-exploitation attack.

"[GhostHook] is neither an elevation nor an exploitation technique. This technique is intended for a post-exploitation scenario where the attacker has control over the asset," CyberArk researchers said.¬†

"Since malicious kernel code (rootkits) often seeks to establish persistence in unfriendly territory, stealth technology plays a fundamental role."


Running Rootkit at Kernel-Level in Windows 10

An attack scenario would include using a hacking exploit or malware first to compromise a target machine and then deploy GhostHook to set up a permanent, secret presence on a compromised 64-bit Windows 10 PC.

Once compromised, an attacker can plant a rootkit in the kernel of the compromised machine, which would be completely undetectable to third-party antivirus and security products and invisible to Microsoft's PatchGuard itself.



CyberArk believes the issue may be extremely difficult for Microsoft to patch, as the technique uses hardware to gain control of critical kernel structures.


GhostHook Exploits Weakness Microsoft's Implementation of Intel PT

GhostHook attack bypasses PatchGuard by leveraging a weakness in Microsoft's implementation of a relatively new feature in Intel processors called Intel PT (Processor Trace), specifically at the point where Intel PT talks to the operating system.

Released months after PatchGuard, Intel PT enables security vendors to monitor and trace commands that are executed in the CPU in an attempt to identify exploits, malware or code before they reach the main operating system.

Although this technology can be abused for legitimate purposes, attackers can also take advantage of the "buffer-is-going-full notification mechanism" in order to take control of a thread‚Äôs execution.

"How can we achieve that with Intel PT? Allocate an extremely small buffer for the CPU‚Äôs PT packets," the researchers said. "This way, the CPU will quickly run out of buffer space and will jump the PMI handler. The PMI handler is a piece of code controlled by us and will perform the 'hook.'"
Hooking techniques, which have both harmless (like application security solutions, system utilities, and tools for programming), as well as malicious (like rootkits) purpose, can give hackers control over the way an operating system or a piece of software behaves.


Microsoft in No Mood to Release a Fix, at least Right Now

Microsoft did not consider GhostHook as a serious threat and told the security firm that the company does not think any emergency any patch is needed but may address in a future version of Windows.

"The engineering team has finished their analysis of this report and determined that it requires the attacker already be running kernel code on the system," said a Microsoft's spokesperson. "As such, this does not meet the bar for servicing in a security update however it may be addressed in a future version of Windows. As such I have closed this case."
In response to this report, Microsoft also released a statement, which reads:

"This technique requires that an attacker has already fully compromised the targeted system. We encourage our customers to practice good computing habits online, including exercising caution when clicking on links to web pages, opening unknown files, or accepting file transfers."
However, CyberArk is disappointed with the company's response, saying Microsoft should realize that PatchGuard is a kernel component which, in any case, should not be bypassed.

Radio-based wireless keyboards and mice that use a special USB dongle to communicate with your PC can expose all your secrets ‚Äì your passwords, credit card numbers and everything you type.

Back in February, researchers from the Internet of things security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Bastille Networks </span>demonstrated how they could take control of wireless keyboards and mice from several top vendors using so-called MouseJack attacks.

The latest findings by the same security firm are even worse.

Researchers have discovered a new hacking technique that can allow hackers to take over your wireless keyboard and secretly record every key you press on it.

Dubbed KeySniffer, the hack is death for millions of wireless, radio-based keyboards.


The Cause: Lack of Encryption and Security Updates

The KeySniffer vulnerability affects wireless keyboards from eight different hardware manufacturers that use cheap transceiver chips (non-Bluetooth chips) ‚Äì a less secure, radio-based communication protocol.

The issue with these chips is that they don‚Äôt receive Bluetooth‚Äôs frequent security updates.

Moreover, the affected keyboards use unencrypted radio transmission.

This means anyone within 100 meters range of your computer and around $15-$30 long-range radio dongle can intercept the communications between affected wireless keyboards and your computer.

Eventually, this allows the attacker to collect secretly everything you type, including your passwords, credit card numbers, personal messages and even weird porn searches.

The keyboards from a surprising range of vendors, including Anker, EagleTec, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, Insignia, Kensington, Radio Shack, and Toshiba, are vulnerable to KeySniffer.

This isn‚Äôt the first time researchers have targeted wireless keyboards. In 2015, a white hat hacker developed a cheap Arduino-based device, dubbed KeySweeper, which covertly logs, decrypts and reports back all keystrokes from Microsoft wireless keyboards.

Although KeySweeper was due to the weak encryption used by Microsoft, the KeySniffer discovery is different as in this case; manufacturers are actually making and selling wireless keyboards with no encryption at all.


One of the affected hardware makers, Kensington responded to this matter, saying that only a single version of its keyboards was affected by KeySniffer flaw and that a firmware update with AES encryption has been released.

Since there are millions of people who do use one of the wireless keyboards identified by Bastille Networks, it has been advised to you to either go back to the wires or at least switch to Bluetooth.

The radio-based wireless keyboards and mice are a good target for hackers. Two months back, the FBI also issued warning for private industry partners to look out for highly stealthy keyloggers that quietly sniff passwords and other input data from wireless keyboards.

Guess how many devices participated in last Friday's massive DDoS attack against DNS provider Dyn that caused vast internet outage?

Just 100,000 devices.

I did not miss any zeros.

Dyn disclosed on Wednesday that a botnet of an estimated 100,000 internet-connected devices was hijacked to flood its systems with unwanted requests and close down the Internet for millions of users.

Dyn executive vice president Scott Hilton has issued a statement, saying all compromised devices have been infected with a notorious Mirai malware that has the ability to take over cameras, DVRs, and routers.
"We're still working on analyzing the data but the estimate at the time of this report is up to 100,000 malicious endpoints," Hilton said. "We are able to confirm that a significant volume of attack traffic originated from Mirai-based botnets."Mirai malware scans for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that are still using their default passwords and then enslaves those devices into a botnet, which is then used to launch DDoS attacks.

A day after the attack, Dyn confirmed that a botnet of Mirai malware-infected devices had participated in its Friday's Distributed Denial of Service attacks.

However, after an initial analysis of the junk traffic, just yesterday, the company revealed that it had identified an estimated 100,000 sources of malicious DDoS traffic, all originating from IoT devices compromised by the Mirai malware.

Earlier the company believed that approximately "tens of millions" of IP addresses were responsible for the massive attack against its crucial systems, but the actual number came out to be much much less, leaving all of us wondering, as:

How did the Attack Succeed to this Massive Level?
To this, Hilton said that Domain Name System protocol itself has the ability to amplify requests from legitimate sources.
"For example, the impact of the attack generated a storm of legitimate retry activity as recursive servers attempted to refresh their caches, creating 10-20X normal traffic volume across a large number of IP addresses," Hilton said. "When DNS traffic congestion occurs, legitimate retries can further contribute to traffic volume."¬†"It appears the malicious attacks were sourced from at least one botnet, with the retry storm providing a false indicator of a significantly larger set of endpoints than we now know it to be."Friday's cyber attack overwhelmed Dyn's central role in routing and managing Internet traffic, rendering hundreds of sites and services, including Twitter, GitHub, Amazon, Netflix, Pinterest, Etsy, Reddit, PayPal, and AirBnb, inaccessible to Millions of people worldwide for several hours.

Dyn did not disclose the actual size of the attack, but it has been speculated that the DDoS attack could be much bigger than the one that hit French Internet service and hosting provider OVH that peaked at 1.1 Tbps, which is the largest DDoS attack known to date.

According to the company, this attack has opened up an important debate about Internet security and volatility.
"Not only has it highlighted vulnerabilities in the security of 'Internet of Things' (IOT) devices that need to be addressed, but it has also sparked further dialogue in the Internet infrastructure community about the future of the Internet," Hilton said.
Next DDoS Attack could reach Tens Of Terabits-Per-Second
If the IoT security is not taken seriously, the future DDoS attack could reach tens of terabits-per-second, as estimated by network security firm<span class="highlight-match"> Corero.</span>

The DDoS threat landscape is skyrocketing and could reach tens of terabits-per-second in size, following a discovery of a new zero-day attack vector that has the ability to amplify DDoS attacks by as much as 55x, Corero warned in a blog post published Tuesday.

According to the security firm, this new attack vector uses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which if combined with an IoT botnet, could break records in DDoS power.

Dave Larson of Corero explains:

"LDAP is not the first, and will not be the last, protocol or service to be exploited in this fashion. Novel amplification attacks like this occur because there are so many open services on the Internet that will respond to spoofed record queries. However, a lot of these attacks could be eased by proper service provider hygiene, by correctly identifying spoofed IP addresses before these requests are admitted to the network."

How to Protect your Smart Device from being Hacked
1. Change Default Passwords of your connected devices: If you have got any internet-connected device at home or work, change your credentials if it still uses default ones. Keep in mind; Mirai malware scans for default settings.

2. Disable Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP): UPnP comes enabled by default in every IoT device, which creates a hole in your router's security, allowing malware to infiltrate any part of your local network.

Check for "Universal Plug and Play" features and turn them OFF.

3. Disable Remote Management through Telnet: Go into your router‚Äôs settings and disable remote management protocol, specifically through Telnet, as this is a protocol used for allowing one computer to control another from a remote location. It has also been used in previous Mirai attacks.

4. Check for Software Updates and Patches: last but not the least, always keep your connected devices and routers up-to-date with the latest vendor firmware.

Check if your IoT device is vulnerable to Mirai malwareThere is an online tool called Bullguard's IoT Scanner that can help you check if any IoT device over your network is vulnerable to Mirai malware.

If it detects any, contact the device's manufacturer or lookout for a solution to patch those vulnerable gaps.

The tool makes use of the vulnerability scanning service Shodan for finding unprotected computers and webcams on your home network that are exposed to the public and potentially accessible to hackers.

	      Hajime ‚ÄòVigilante Botnet‚Äô Growing Rapidly; Hijacks 300,000 IoT Devices Worldwide [1.02 Points on average]

Last week, we reported about a so-called 'vigilante hacker' who hacked into at least 10,000 vulnerable 'Internet of Things' devices, such as home routers and Internet-connected cameras, using a botnet malware in order to supposedly secure them.

Now, that vigilante hacker has already trapped roughly 300,000 devices in an IoT botnet known as Hajime, according to a new report published Tuesday by Kaspersky Lab, and this number will rise with each day that passes by.

The IoT botnet malware was emerged in October 2016, around the same time when the infamous Mirai botnet threatened the Internet last year with record-setting distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the popular DNS provider Dyn.


How the Hajime IoT Botnet Works

Hajime botnet works much like Mirai by spreading itself via unsecured IoT devices that have open Telnet ports and uses default passwords and also uses the same list of username and password combinations that Mirai is programmed to use.

However, the interesting part of Hajime botnet is that, unlike Mirai, once Hajime infects an IoT devices, it secures the devices by blocking access to four ports (23, 7547, 5555, and 5358) known to be the most widely used vectors for infecting IoT devices, making Mirai or other threats out of their bay.

Hajime also uses a decentralized peer-to-peer network (instead of command-and-control server) to issue updates to infected devices, making it more difficult for ISPs and Internet providers to take down the botnet.

One of the most interesting things about Hajime is the botnet also displays a cryptographically signed message every 10 minutes or so on infected device terminals, describing its creators as "just a white hat, securing some systems."

Unlike Mirai and other IoT botnets, Hajime lacks DDoS capabilities and other hacking skills except for the propagation code that lets one infected IoT device search for other vulnerable devices and infects them.


But What if‚Ä¶?

What's not known is: What the Hajime Botnet is for? or Who is behind it?

"The most intriguing thing about Hajime is its purpose," says Kaspersky security researchers. "While the botnet is getting bigger and bigger, partly due to new exploitation modules, its purpose remains unknown. We haven‚Äôt seen it being used in any type of attack or malicious activity, adding that "its real purpose remains unknown."
Also, the researchers believe that this might not happen, because Hajime botnet takes steps to hide its running processes and files on the file system, making the detection of infected systems more difficult.

So far, the purpose behind building this botnet is not entirely clear, but all signs yet point to a possible white-hat hacker, who is on his/her mission to secure open and vulnerable systems over the Internet.


However, the most concerning issue of all ‚Äî Is there any guarantee that the Hajime author will not add attack capabilities to the worm to use the hijacked devices for malicious purposes?

Maybe today the Hajime author is in the mission to secure the world, but tomorrow, when he would realize he could make money online by renting his/her botnet to others, he could be another Adam Mudd.

Mudd, a 19-year-old teenager, has recently been sentenced to 2 years in prison for creating and running a DDoS-for-hire service called 'Titanium Stresser' that made more than 1.7 million victims of DDoS attacks since 2013.


Secondly, What if the well-intentioned botnet is hijacked by some malicious actor?

If this happens, the vigilant IoT botnet could be used for malicious purposes, such as conducting DDoS attacks against online sites and services, spreading malware, or instantly bricking the infected devices at one click.
<span class="highlight-match">
Radware </span>researchers also believe that the flexible and extensible nature of the Hajime botnet can be used for malicious purposes, like those mentioned above and conducting real-time mass surveillance from Internet-connected webcams, according to a new threat¬†advisory published Wednesday by Radware.


Last but not the least: Do we seriously need some vigilante hackers to protect our devices and network?

This solution could be temporary, trust me. For example, the latest Hajime botnet is nothing but a band-aid.

Since Hajime has no persistence mechanism, as soon as the infected device is rebooted, it goes back to its previously unsecured state, with default passwords and the Telnet port open to the world.


How to Protect your IoT devices?

The only true solution is You ‚Äî Instead of just sitting over there, doing nothing and waiting for some vigilante hackers to do miracles, you can protect your IoT devices in a way Hajime or any well-intentioned botnet can't do.

So go and update the firmware of your devices, change their default passwords, put them behind a firewall, and if any device is by default vulnerable and cannot be updated, throw it and buy a new one.

Just keep in mind: Once a single IoT of yours gets compromised, your whole network falls under risk of getting compromised and so all your devices which are connected to that network.

A teenage student has been charged with running a supplying malware that was used for launching distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against websites of some of the world's leading businesses.

Jack Chappell, an 18-year-old teenager from Stockport, is accused of helping cyber criminals with his DDoS booter service (DDoS-for-hire service) to flood millions of websites around the world with the massive amount of data and eventually bring them down, making them unavailable to their users.

Among the victims that were allegedly attacked by Chappell's malware are the National Crime Agency (NCA), T-Mobile, O2, Virgin Media, the BBC, Amazon, Vodafone,<span class="highlight-match"> BT,</span> Netflix, and NatWest that had its online banking systems down in a 2015 cyber attack.

Chappell is charged following an investigation led by the West Midlands Regional Cyber Crime Unit and assisted by Israeli Police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Europol‚Äôs European Cybercrime Centre (EC3).

According to authorities, the teenager rented his DDoS-for-hire service to criminals and also ran an online helpdesk for would-be hackers as part of his operation.

"He has been charged with impairing the operation of computers under the Computer Misuse Act, plus encouraging or assisting an offense and money laundering crime proceeds together with an American national," West Midlands Police said in a statement.

Chappell is due to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on July 4, Tuesday.

Late last year, another 19-year-old student from Hertford (Town in the UK) was pled guilty for running Titanium Stresser DDoS-for-hire service, one of the most popular DDoS booter tool that was used to launch over 1.7 Million DDoS attacks worldwide and brought him an income of more than US$385,000.

The United States government has released a rare alert about an ongoing, eight-year-long North Korean state-sponsored hacking operation.

The joint report from the FBI and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provided details on "DeltaCharlie," a malware variant used by "Hidden Cobra" hacking group to infect hundreds of thousands of computers globally as part of its DDoS botnet network.

According to the report, the Hidden Cobra group of hackers are believed to be backed by the North Korean government and are known to launch cyber attacks against global institutions, including media organizations, aerospace and financial sectors, and critical infrastructure.

While the US government has labeled the North Korean hacking group Hidden Cobra, it is often known as Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace ‚Äì the one allegedly linked to the devastating WannaCry ransomware menace that shut down hospitals and businesses worldwide.


DeltaCharlie ‚Äì DDoS Botnet Malware

The agencies identified IP addresses with "high confidence" associated with "DeltaCharlie" ‚Äì a DDoS tool which the DHS and FBI believe North Korea uses to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against its targets.

DeltaCharlie is capable of launching a variety of DDoS attacks on its targets, including Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, Network Time Protocol (NTP) attacks, and Character Generation Protocol (CGP) attacks.

The botnet malware is capable of downloading executables on the infected systems, updating its own binaries, changing its own configuration in real-time, terminating its processes, and activating and terminating DDoS attacks.

However, the DeltaCharlie DDoS malware is not new.

DeltaCharlie was initially reported by<span class="highlight-match"> Novetta </span>in their 2016 Operation Blockbuster Malware Report [PDF], which described this as the third botnet malware from the North Korean hacking group, after DeltaAlpha and DeltaBravo.

Other malware used by Hidden Cobra include Destover, Wild Positron or Duuzer, and Hangman with sophisticated capabilities, including DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware.


Hidden Cobra's Favorite Vulnerabilities

Operating since 2009, Hidden Cobra typically targets systems running older, unsupported versions of Microsoft operating systems, and commonly exploits vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player to gain an initial entry point into victim's machine.

These are the known vulnerabilities affecting various applications usually exploited by  Hidden Cobra:

Hangul Word Processor bug (CVE-2015-6585)
Microsoft Silverlight flaw (CVE-2015-8651)
Adobe Flash Player 18.0.0.324 and 19.x vulnerability (CVE-2016-0034)
Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.197 Vulnerability (CVE-2016-1019)
Adobe Flash Player 21.0.0.226 Vulnerability (CVE-2016-4117)

The simplest way to defend against such attacks is always to keep your operating system and installed software and applications up-to-date, and protect your network assets behind a firewall.

Since Adobe Flash Player is prone to many attacks and just today the company patched nine vulnerability in Player, you are advised to update or remove it completely from your computer.

The FBI and DHS have provided numerous indicators of compromise (IOCs), malware descriptions, network signatures, as well as host-based rules (YARA rules) in an attempt to help defenders detect activity conducted by the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group.

"If users or administrators detect the custom tools indicative of HIDDEN COBRA, these tools should be immediately flagged, reported to the DHS National Cybersecurity Communications and Integration Center (NCCIC) or the FBI Cyber Watch (CyWatch), and given highest priority for enhanced mitigation," the alert reads.
Besides this, the agencies have also provided a long list of mitigations for users and network administrators, which you can follow here.

Popular antivirus service<span class="highlight-match"> Webroot </span>mistakenly flagged core Windows system files as malicious and even started temporarily removing some of the legit files, trashing user computers around the world.

The havoc caused after the company released a bad update on April 24, which was pulled after approximately 15 minutes. But that still hasn't stopped some PCs from receiving it, causing serious issues for not just individuals, but also companies and organizations relying on the software.


Webroot even Blocked Facebook


According to the reports by many customers on social media and Webroot's forum, hundreds and even thousands of systems were broken down after antivirus software flagged hundreds of benign files needed to run Windows and apps that run on top of the operating system.

The faulty update even caused the antivirus to incorrectly block access to Facebook after flagging the social network service as a phishing website, preventing users from accessing the social network.

"Webroot has not been breached and customers are not at risk," the company said on its online forum. "Legitimate malicious files are being identified and blocked as normal."


What all went Wrong?

The buggy update caused Webroot anti-virus service to detect legitimate Windows files, including those signed by Microsoft, as W32.Trojan.Gen files ‚Äì generic malware, in other words.

This behavior, eventually, moved critical Windows system files essential to the operating system's effective functioning into quarantine, making them unavailable to Windows and rendering hundreds of thousands of computers unstable.

Even files associated with some of the applications had also been flagged as malicious and quarantined.


Webroot is Working on a Universal Fix

Webroot, which claims to have over 30 million customers last year, has suggested fixes for those using the Home edition and Business edition of its anti-virus software.

The company's technical team also moved quickly and pushed a fix for the Facebook issue last night, according to the post on the company's forum.

However, the company has yet to provide a definitive fix for its entire affected user base. The company confirms that it's "currently working on this universal solution now," but did not say when it would arrive.


What Affected Users should do

Meanwhile, the company has provided workarounds to restore files and prevent its antivirus from re-detecting the same Windows files as W32.Trojan.Gen, though it is only useful for home edition users and not for managed services providers (MSPs).

However, one user on Webroot's forum is reporting that uninstalling Webroot, then restoring quarantined files from a backup drive, and then re-installing Webroot believes in fixing the issue.

	      Chinese Certificate Authority 'mistakenly' gave out SSL Certs for GitHub Domains [0.95 Points on average]

A Chinese certificate authority (CA) appeared to be making a significant security blunder by handing out duplicate SSL certificates for a base domain if someone just has control over its any subdomain. 

The certificate authority, named WoSign, issued a base certificate for the Github domains to an unnamed GitHub user.

But How? First of all, do you know, the traditional Digital Certificate Management System is the weakest link on the Internet today and has already been broken?

Billions of Internet users blindly rely on hundreds of Certificate Authorities (CA) around the globe to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of their personal data.

But, these CAs have powers to issue valid SSL cert for any domain you own, despite the fact you already have one purchased from another CA. 

...and that's the biggest loophole in the CA system.

In the latest case as well, WoSign issued a duplicate SSL certificate for GitHub domains without verifying ownership of the base domain.

The incident was first publicly disclosed by British Mozilla programmer Gervase Markham on Mozilla's security policy mailing list saying the issue occurred over a year ago in July 2015 but went unreported.

"In June 2015, an applicant found a problem with WoSign's free certificate service, which allowed them to get a certificate for the base domain if they were able to prove control of a subdomain," Markham wrote in the mailing list.
According to Markham, an unnamed security researcher accidentally discovered this security blunder when trying to get a certificate for 'med.ucf.edu' but mistakenly also applied for 'www.ucf.edu' and WoSign approved it, handing over the certificate for the university's primary domain.

For testing purpose, the researcher also used this trick against Github base domains i.e. github.com and github.io, by proving his control over a user-based subdomain.

...And guess what? WoSign handed over the certificate for GitHub main domains, too.

The researcher reported this issue to WoSign by giving only the Github certificate as an example. Thus, the Chinese CA only revoked the GitHub certificate, despite revoking both the certificates.

Why Just One? It is quite possible that the CA company doesn't have any tracking ability to discover and revoke all mistakenly issued base certificates for other domains by self-investigation even after getting informed of the problem.

The researcher recently got in touch with Google and reported that the ucf.edu cert had still not been revoked almost a year later.

How to check whether a rogue cert for your domain has been issued to someone else, probably a malicious attacker?



Solution: Certificate Transparency or CT, a public service that allows individuals and companies to monitor how many digital security certs have secretly been issued for their domains.

Certificate Transparency requires CAs to declare publicly (to Certificate Log) every digital cert they have generated. Even WoSign has participated in CT.

Certificate Log offers you a way to look up all of the digital certificates that have been issued for your domain name.

Although Certificate Transparency doesn't prevent CA from issuing forged certificates, it makes the process of detecting rogue certificates much easier.

Currently, Google, Symantec,<span class="highlight-match"> DigiCert,</span> and a few other CAs are hosting public CT logs. 

You can try Google's Certificate Transparency Lookup Tool or Comodo's Certificate Transparency Search tool to check all certificates present in public Certificate Transparency logs that have been issued for your domain.

If you find a fraud certificate issued for your domain, report respective CA and address it immediately.
